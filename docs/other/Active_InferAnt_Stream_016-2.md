## Overview

This livestream explores the intersection of human expertise and generative AI in educational content creation, demonstrating how faculty and faculties can leverage cognitive skills/postures and synthetic intelligence tools to create custom, modularly configured, legibly generated, curricula.

We will look at what is at hand, and almost at hand, for three areas of Generative education and research: 
- 📚 Custom modular curriculum https://github.com/docxology/curriculum
- 🔬 Research and meta-analysis https://github.com/docxology/literature
- 📄 Scientific integral/holistic consideration (from notes and codebases to rendered PDF) https://github.com/docxology/template/

## Where We Are

Open for all to fork, contribute, improve! 
- 📚 Curriculum https://github.com/docxology/curriculum
- 🔬 Research https://github.com/docxology/literature
- 📄 Development https://github.com/docxology/template/

## Where We Are Going

### The Hill We Are On

- **Custom generated curriculum** for *any* topic:
  - Any number of **modules** or **sessions**
  - Any combination of educational materials: Lectures, Labs, Study notes, Diagrams, Questions, Applications, Extensions, Visualizations, Integrations, Investigations, Open questions
  - **Fully customizable** for the specific needs of each institution and course
  - **Infrastructure** to create, version, and manage content, whether:
    - Done manually _or_
    - Leveraging AI-assisted approaches

---

### The Next Hills

- As many....
  - *"Oughts"* – _What should we do with these capabilities?_
- ....As there are:
  - *"Is"'s* – _What is true, what would support accurate, effective, and aligned generative synthetic intelligence?_

---

### Past and Future Always Already Now

- **Taylor series as generalized coordinate inference** — seeking a harmonic convergence of multiscale tactics and strategy; a nested continuum.
- This recursive (and quantum) cognitive effect arises through learning and applying **Active Inference**.
- That pattern/pump applies to "individual" (top-down, many-as-one, High Road) and the group (bottom-up, Low Road).
- Debatably and engagingly, the patterns applies to the analytical (axiomatic), empirical (evidential), and phenomenological (Husserlian shared protentions).
- Augmented cognition in the niche where "The Body and the Niche Keep The Score" while playing the game.
