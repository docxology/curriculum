## Overview

This livestream explores the intersection of human expertise and generative AI in educational content creation, demonstrating how faculty and faculties can leverage cognitive skills/postures and synthetic intelligence tools to create custom, modularly configured, legibly generated, curricula.

The presentation provides open source resources and methods for people who want to apply these tools today, and also provides a space for discussion and envisioning the future of generative education and research.

In the YouTube livechat, provide any suggestions, questions, comments, or prompts. And during the stream we can pick one or more topics to write curriculum for, do literature meta-analysis on, and write a software package + paper for.  

We will look at what is at hand, and almost at hand, for three areas of Generative education and research:

- 📚 **Custom modular curriculum** — [curriculum](https://github.com/docxology/curriculum)
- 🔬 **Research and meta-analysis** — [literature](https://github.com/docxology/literature)
- 📄 **Scientific integral/holistic consideration** (from notes and codebases to rendered PDF) — [template](https://github.com/docxology/template/)

## Where We Are

Open for all to fork, contribute, improve!

- 📚 **Curriculum** — [curriculum](https://github.com/docxology/curriculum)
- 🔬 **Research** — [literature](https://github.com/docxology/literature)
- 📄 **Development** — [template](https://github.com/docxology/template/)

## Where We Are Going

### The Hill We Are On

- **Custom generated curriculum** for *any* topic:
  - Any number of **modules** or **sessions**
  - Any combination of educational materials: Lectures, Labs, Study notes, Diagrams, Questions, Applications, Extensions, Visualizations, Integrations, Investigations, Open questions
  - **Fully customizable** for the specific needs of each institution and course
  - **Infrastructure** to create, version, and manage content, whether:
    - Done manually _or_
    - Leveraging AI-assisted approaches

## Agenda

### 0. 🔧 Background
- 🛠️ **Tools:** Cursor 2.2, Ollama with llama, qwen, gemma, and other local LLM models

### 1. 🏗️ Repository Walkthrough
- 📐 **GitHub README:** Project structure and architecture
- ⚙️ **Configuration-driven** course generation
- 🔄 **Modular content** pipeline
- 🤖 **Integration** with Ollama and local LLMs

### 2. 🎓 Generating Custom Curriculum
- 🎬 **Live demonstration** of course outline generation
- 🎨 **Customizing content** for specific educational contexts
- ⚖️ **Balancing** AI-generated content with human expertise
- ✅ **Quality assurance** and validation workflows

### 3. 💭 Discussion: The Future of Faculty in Generative Education
- **❓ Central Question:** What will we do with our faculty?
- 🧠 **Exploring** the role of human expertise in AI-assisted education
- 🎯 **Maintaining** pedagogical quality and academic standards
- 👥 **Faculty roles:** Curators, validators, and enhancers of AI-generated content

### Past and Future Always Already Now

- **Taylor series as generalized coordinate inference** — seeking a harmonic convergence of multiscale tactics and strategy; a nested continuum.
- This recursive (and quantum) cognitive effect arises through learning and applying **Active Inference**.
- That pattern/pump applies to "individual" (top-down, many-as-one, High Road) and the group (bottom-up, Low Road).
- Debatably and engagingly, the pattern applies to the analytical (axiomatic), empirical (evidential), and phenomenological (Husserlian shared protentions).
- Augmented cognition in the niche where "The Body and the Niche Keep The Score" while playing the game as well.

### The Next Hills

As many "Oughts" — *What should we do with these capabilities?* — as there are "Is"'s — *What is true, what would support accurate, effective, and aligned generative synthetic intelligence?*
