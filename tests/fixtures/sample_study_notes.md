# Cell Biology - Study Notes

## Key Concepts

### Cell Theory
- All living organisms are composed of cells
- The cell is the basic unit of life
- All cells come from pre-existing cells
- **Study Tip**: Remember the three tenets - use the mnemonic "All Cells Come" (All organisms, Cells are basic, Come from cells)

### Cell Types

#### Prokaryotic Cells
- **No nucleus** - DNA in nucleoid region
- **Smaller** - typically 1-10 micrometers
- **Examples**: Bacteria, Archaea
- **Key structures**: Cell wall, cell membrane, ribosomes, nucleoid

#### Eukaryotic Cells
- **Has nucleus** - DNA in chromosomes
- **Larger** - typically 10-100 micrometers
- **Examples**: Animals, plants, fungi, protists
- **Key structures**: Nucleus, organelles, cytoskeleton

### Important Organelles

| Organelle | Function | Found In |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Nucleus | DNA storage, gene expression | Eukaryotes |
| Mitochondria | Cellular respiration, ATP production | Eukaryotes |
| Chloroplasts | Photosynthesis | Plants, algae |
| ER (Rough) | Protein synthesis | Eukaryotes |
| ER (Smooth) | Lipid synthesis | Eukaryotes |
| Golgi Apparatus | Protein modification, packaging | Eukaryotes |
| Lysosomes | Digestion, waste removal | Animals |
| Ribosomes | Protein synthesis | All cells |

### Cell Membrane

**Structure**: Phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins

**Functions**:
1. Selective barrier
2. Cell communication
3. Cell recognition
4. Transport

**Components**:
- **Phospholipids**: Hydrophilic heads, hydrophobic tails
- **Proteins**: Channel, carrier, receptor, recognition
- **Cholesterol**: Membrane fluidity (in animal cells)
- **Carbohydrates**: Cell recognition (glycoproteins, glycolipids)

### Transport Mechanisms

#### Passive Transport (No energy required)
- **Diffusion**: Movement from high to low concentration
- **Osmosis**: Diffusion of water across membrane
- **Facilitated diffusion**: Using channel or carrier proteins

#### Active Transport (Requires energy - ATP)
- **Sodium-potassium pump**: 3 Na+ out, 2 K+ in
- **Endocytosis**: Taking materials into cell
  - Phagocytosis: "cell eating"
  - Pinocytosis: "cell drinking"
  - Receptor-mediated: specific molecules
- **Exocytosis**: Releasing materials from cell

### Cell Division

#### Mitosis
- **Purpose**: Growth, repair, asexual reproduction
- **Result**: Two identical daughter cells (2n → 2n)
- **Phases**: Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase (PMAT)
- **Cytokinesis**: Division of cytoplasm

#### Meiosis
- **Purpose**: Sexual reproduction, gamete formation
- **Result**: Four non-identical cells with half the chromosomes (2n → n)
- **Phases**: Two divisions (Meiosis I and II)
- **Key processes**: Crossing over, independent assortment

## Important Vocabulary

- **Cytoplasm**: Gel-like substance filling the cell
- **Nucleoid**: Region in prokaryotes containing DNA
- **Chromatin**: Unwound DNA in nucleus
- **Chromosome**: Condensed DNA during division
- **Organelle**: Specialized cellular structure
- **Cytoskeleton**: Protein filaments providing structure
- **Centrioles**: Organize spindle fibers during division (animal cells)
- **Vacuole**: Storage organelle (large in plant cells)
- **Cell wall**: Rigid outer layer (plants, bacteria, fungi)

## Study Tips

### For Exams
1. **Make comparison tables** - Prokaryote vs. Eukaryote, Plant vs. Animal
2. **Draw and label diagrams** - Practice without looking
3. **Use mnemonics** - PMAT for mitosis phases
4. **Understand, don't memorize** - Know WHY things happen
5. **Focus on functions** - Connect structure to function

### Common Exam Questions
1. Compare and contrast prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
2. Explain the function of major organelles
3. Describe the structure and function of the cell membrane
4. Compare passive and active transport
5. Explain the phases of mitosis
6. Describe the process of protein synthesis from nucleus to secretion

### Practice Problems

1. **If a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, what happens?**
   - Answer: Water moves out of the cell by osmosis; cell shrinks

2. **What organelles would be abundant in a cell that secretes proteins?**
   - Answer: Ribosomes (make proteins), rough ER (synthesis), Golgi apparatus (packaging), vesicles (transport)

3. **How do plant and animal cells differ structurally?**
   - Answer: Plants have cell wall, chloroplasts, large central vacuole; Animals have centrioles, smaller vacuoles, lysosomes

## Visual Aids

### Cell Structure Diagram
```
[Draw a labeled cell showing]:
- Cell membrane
- Nucleus (with nucleolus)
- Mitochondria
- Endoplasmic reticulum (rough and smooth)
- Golgi apparatus
- Ribosomes

```

### Membrane Transport
```
[Draw diagram showing]:
- Diffusion (high → low concentration)
- Osmosis (water movement)
- Active transport (low → high, using ATP)
```
