## Introduction

Cells are the fundamental units of life. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells, and the cell is the smallest unit that can carry out all the processes of life. Understanding cellular structure and function is essential to understanding biology at all levels.

## Cell Theory

The cell theory is one of the fundamental principles of biology:

1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells
2. The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms
3. All cells come from pre-existing cells

This theory was developed in the mid-19th century through the work of multiple scientists and remains a cornerstone of modern biology.

## Cell Types

There are two main types of cells:

### Prokaryotic Cells

- Lack a membrane-bound nucleus
- DNA is in a region called the nucleoid
- Generally smaller and simpler
- Examples: bacteria and archaea

### Eukaryotic Cells

- Have a membrane-bound nucleus
- DNA is organized into chromosomes
- Contains membrane-bound organelles
- Examples: animals, plants, fungi, protists

## Cell Structure

### Cell Membrane

The cell membrane is a selective barrier that:

- Separates the cell from its environment
- Regulates what enters and exits the cell
- Is composed of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins

### Nucleus

The nucleus is the control center of the cell:

- Contains genetic material (DNA)
- Surrounded by nuclear envelope
- Site of DNA replication and transcription

### Organelles

Key organelles and their functions:

- **Mitochondria**: Energy production (cellular respiration)
- **Endoplasmic Reticulum**: Protein and lipid synthesis
- **Golgi Apparatus**: Protein modification and packaging
- **Lysosomes**: Cellular digestion
- **Ribosomes**: Protein synthesis

## Cell Division

Cells reproduce through division:

- **Mitosis**: Produces two identical daughter cells
- **Meiosis**: Produces gametes (sex cells) with half the genetic material

## Summary

Understanding cell structure and function is fundamental to biology. Cells carry out all life processes through the coordinated action of their components. The diversity of cell types and their specializations allow for the complexity of multicellular organisms.

## Key Terms

- **Cell membrane**: Selective barrier surrounding the cell
- **Nucleus**: Membrane-bound organelle containing DNA
- **Organelle**: Specialized structure within a cell
- **Prokaryote**: Cell without a membrane-bound nucleus
- **Eukaryote**: Cell with a membrane-bound nucleus
- **Mitosis**: Cell division producing identical daughter cells
