# Lab 1: Cell Structure and Microscopy

## Objective

To observe and identify cellular structures using light microscopy and compare prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.

## Materials

- Light microscope
- Prepared slides:
  - Bacterial cells (prokaryotic)
  - Onion epidermis (plant eukaryotic)
  - Cheek cells (animal eukaryotic)
- Lens paper
- Immersion oil (if using oil immersion)
- Lab notebook
- Colored pencils for drawings

## Safety Precautions

- Handle glass slides carefully
- Clean microscope lenses only with lens paper
- Report any broken glass to instructor immediately
- Wash hands after handling biological materials

## Procedure

### Part 1: Microscope Setup and Use

1. Carry microscope with two hands (one on arm, one under base)
2. Place microscope on flat, stable surface
3. Plug in microscope if using illumination
4. Start with lowest power objective (4x or 10x)
5. Adjust light intensity to comfortable level

### Part 2: Observing Bacterial Cells

1. Place bacterial slide on stage
2. Focus using coarse adjustment, then fine adjustment
3. Switch to higher power (40x) to observe details
4. Note:
   - Cell size (very small compared to eukaryotes)
   - Cell shape (cocci, bacilli, or spirilla)
   - Lack of visible internal structures
5. Draw 5-10 cells in your lab notebook
6. Measure approximate cell size using ocular micrometer (if available)

### Part 3: Observing Plant Cells (Onion Epidermis)

1. Place onion epidermis slide on stage
2. Focus at low power, then increase magnification
3. Identify and observe:
   - Cell wall (thick outer boundary)
   - Cell membrane (inside cell wall)
   - Nucleus (large, dark organelle)
   - Cytoplasm (granular material)
   - Vacuole (large clear area)
4. Draw 3-5 cells showing all visible structures
5. Label all identified structures

### Part 4: Observing Animal Cells (Cheek Cells)

1. Place cheek cell slide on stage
2. Focus at low power, then increase magnification
3. Identify and observe:
   - Cell membrane (outer boundary - no cell wall)
   - Nucleus (dark, centrally located)
   - Cytoplasm
4. Compare to plant cells - note differences
5. Draw 3-5 cells with labels

### Part 5: Comparison

Create a comparison table in your notebook:

| Feature | Prokaryotic (Bacteria) | Eukaryotic (Plant) | Eukaryotic (Animal) |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Cell size | | | |
| Nucleus | | | |
| Cell wall | | | |
| Organelles | | | |

## Analysis Questions

1. What is the approximate size difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?

2. What structures are present in plant cells but not in animal cells? Why?

3. Why are organelles not visible in prokaryotic cells under light microscopy?

4. What are the advantages of having membrane-bound organelles?

5. How does cell structure relate to cell function for each cell type observed?

## Cleanup

1. Return all slides to proper storage
2. Clean microscope stage
3. Return microscope to lowest power objective
4. Unplug and cover microscope (if applicable)
5. Clean workspace
6. Wash hands

## Lab Report Requirements

Submit a lab report including:

1. **Title and Date**
2. **Objective** (in your own words)
3. **Drawings**:
   - Bacterial cells
   - Plant cells
   - Animal cells
   - All drawings must be labeled and include magnification
4. **Comparison Table** (completed)
5. **Analysis Questions** (answered in complete sentences)
6. **Conclusion** (2-3 paragraphs summarizing what you learned)

## Grading Rubric

- Drawings (accuracy and labels): 30 points
- Comparison table: 20 points
- Analysis questions: 30 points
- Conclusion: 15 points
- Lab technique and cleanup: 5 points

**Total: 100 points**

## Due Date

Lab report due at the beginning of next lab session.
