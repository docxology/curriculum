7. Explain the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.

**Answer:**
Prokaryotic cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Their DNA is located in a region called the nucleoid. They are generally smaller (1-10 μm) and simpler in structure. Examples include bacteria and archaea.

Eukaryotic cells have a membrane-bound nucleus containing their DNA, as well as membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus. They are generally larger (10-100 μm) and more complex. Examples include animal, plant, fungal, and protist cells.

8. What is the fluid mosaic model of the cell membrane?

**Answer:**
The fluid mosaic model describes the cell membrane as a flexible structure composed of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded and associated proteins. The "fluid" aspect refers to the ability of phospholipids and proteins to move laterally within the layer. The "mosaic" aspect refers to the patchwork pattern of different proteins embedded in or attached to the phospholipid bilayer. This model explains how the membrane can be both selective and dynamic.

10. List three organelles found in plant cells but not in animal cells, and explain why plants need them.

**Answer:**
1. **Cell Wall**: Provides rigid structure and support since plants don't have skeletons. Made of cellulose.

2. **Chloroplasts**: Site of photosynthesis where plants convert light energy into chemical energy (glucose). Plants need this because they are autotrophs (make their own food).

3. **Large Central Vacuole**: Stores water, nutrients, and waste products. Helps maintain turgor pressure which keeps plant cells rigid and the plant upright.

## Application Problems

12. A cell is placed in a solution and begins to swell and eventually bursts. What type of solution was the cell placed in? Explain using the concept of osmosis.

**Answer:**
The cell was placed in a **hypotonic solution** (lower solute concentration outside the cell than inside).

Explanation:
- In a hypotonic solution, the concentration of solutes is lower outside the cell than inside
- Water molecules move by osmosis from high concentration (outside) to low concentration (inside)
- Water enters the cell, causing it to swell
- If too much water enters, the cell membrane cannot contain the pressure and the cell bursts (lyses)
- This is why animal cells in pure water will eventually burst
- Plant cells resist bursting because of their rigid cell wall, instead becoming turgid

13. A scientist is studying a cell that has many mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum but no chloroplasts. What can you infer about this cell?

**Answer:**

Inferences:
1. **It is likely a eukaryotic animal cell**:
   - Has many organelles (mitochondria, rough ER)
   - Lacks chloroplasts (not a plant cell)

2. **It is metabolically very active**:
   - Many mitochondria indicate high energy (ATP) requirements
   - Cellular respiration is important for this cell

3. **It produces many proteins**:
   - Abundant rough ER indicates active protein synthesis
   - Likely secretes proteins or uses many proteins for internal functions

4. **Possible cell types**:
   - Pancreatic cell (secretes digestive enzymes)
   - Liver cell (many metabolic functions)
   - Muscle cell (needs ATP for contraction)
   - Immune cell (produces antibodies)

14. Explain the pathway a protein takes from synthesis to secretion from a cell.

**Answer:**

1. **Nucleus**: DNA is transcribed to mRNA
2. **Rough ER**: mRNA moves to ribosomes on rough ER; protein is synthesized and enters ER lumen
3. **Inside Rough ER**: Protein begins to fold into correct shape; initial modifications may occur
4. **Transport Vesicle**: Protein is packaged into vesicle that buds off from ER
5. **Golgi Apparatus**: Vesicle fuses with Golgi; protein enters Golgi
6. **Golgi Processing**: Protein is modified, sorted, and packaged (may add carbohydrates, fold further)
7. **Secretory Vesicle**: Modified protein is packaged into vesicle that buds from Golgi
8. **Cell Membrane**: Vesicle moves to cell membrane
9. **Exocytosis**: Vesicle fuses with cell membrane and releases protein outside cell

This pathway demonstrates the endomembrane system working together to produce and secrete proteins.

15. A student observes that red blood cells placed in pure water swell and burst, but the same cells placed in sea water shrink. Explain these observations.

**Answer:**

**In Pure Water (Hypotonic Solution)**:
- Pure water has 0% solute, red blood cells have ~0.9% solute
- Water concentration is higher outside the cell than inside
- Osmosis causes water to move INTO the cell
- Cell swells as water enters
- Cell membrane cannot withstand pressure and bursts (hemolysis)

**In Sea Water (Hypertonic Solution)**:
- Sea water has ~3.5% solute, higher than red blood cells (~0.9%)
- Water concentration is lower outside the cell than inside
- Osmosis causes water to move OUT of the cell
- Cell shrinks as water leaves (crenation)
- Cell becomes wrinkled and shriveled

**Conclusion**:
This demonstrates the importance of osmotic balance. Red blood cells must be in an isotonic solution (same concentration as cell interior, ~0.9% saline) to maintain normal shape and function. This is why intravenous fluids are carefully formulated to match body fluid concentration.

## Critical Thinking

16. Antibiotics often work by targeting structures found in prokaryotic cells but not in eukaryotic cells. Why is this an effective strategy for treating bacterial infections in humans?

**Answer:**

This is an effective strategy because:

1. **Selective toxicity**: By targeting prokaryotic-specific structures, antibiotics can kill bacteria without harming human (eukaryotic) cells

2. **Examples of prokaryotic-specific targets**:
   - Cell wall synthesis (penicillin targets peptidoglycan in bacterial cell walls; humans don't have cell walls)
   - 70S ribosomes (different from eukaryotic 80S ribosomes)
   - Unique metabolic pathways found only in bacteria

3. **Benefits**:
   - Kills bacteria while minimizing damage to patient's own cells
   - Reduces side effects
   - Allows the immune system to continue functioning

4. **Limitations**:
   - Doesn't help against viruses (they lack cellular structures)
   - Some antibiotics still have side effects (affecting mitochondria, which have prokaryotic origins)
   - Antibiotic resistance can develop

This strategy is based on understanding the fundamental differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, demonstrating the practical application of cell biology knowledge in medicine.

## Essay Question

17. Describe the relationship between cell structure and function, using at least three specific examples of organelles.

**Answer:**

The relationship between cell structure and function is one of the fundamental principles in biology - the structure of cellular components is directly related to their function. This principle is evident in organelles throughout the cell.

**Example 1: Mitochondria**

Mitochondria are often called the "powerhouses" of the cell because they produce ATP through cellular respiration. Their structure perfectly supports this function:
- Double membrane creates separate compartments for different stages of respiration
- Inner membrane is highly folded (cristae), increasing surface area for ATP production
- Matrix contains enzymes needed for the Krebs cycle
- This structure maximizes efficiency of energy production

**Example 2: Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum**

The rough ER is responsible for protein synthesis and initial processing:
- Covered with ribosomes (giving it a "rough" appearance) for protein production
- Extensive network of membranes provides large surface area for ribosome attachment
- Internal space (lumen) allows for protein folding and modification
- Connected to nuclear envelope for easy access to genetic instructions
- Structure allows for efficient, large-scale protein production

**Example 3: Chloroplasts (in plant cells)**

Chloroplasts are the sites of photosynthesis:
- Double membrane separates internal environment from cytoplasm
- Thylakoid membranes (organized in stacks called grana) contain chlorophyll and capture light energy
- Large surface area of thylakoid membranes maximizes light absorption
- Stroma (fluid space) contains enzymes for carbon fixation
- Structure optimizes both light-dependent and light-independent reactions

**Conclusion:**

These examples demonstrate that cellular structures are not random but are specifically organized to perform their functions efficiently. The relationship between structure and function applies at all levels of biological organization, from molecules to organelles to cells to organisms. Understanding this relationship is key to understanding how cells work and how organisms function as a whole.
