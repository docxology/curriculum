# Educational Course Configuration - Active Inference & AI (Short Course)
# Concise course connecting Active Inference principles to contemporary AI applications

course:
  name: "Active Inference for Generative AI: Principles and Applications"
  subject: "AI, Machine Learning, and Cognitive Systems"
  description: |
    A focused introduction to Active Inference principles and their applications in contemporary AI systems. 
    This course provides an intuitive understanding of how Active Inference—the principle that adaptive systems 
    minimize variational free energy through perception, action, and learning—relates to and enhances modern 
    generative AI architectures. Students will explore how variational inference, predictive coding, and Bayesian 
    model selection connect to transformer architectures, large language models, and diffusion models. The course 
    examines how Active Inference principles inform key challenges in 2025's AI landscape: alignment (ensuring AI 
    systems pursue intended goals through proper generative models and precision weighting), multiagent coordination 
    (how multiple AI agents achieve shared inference through free energy minimization), spatial intelligence 
    (embodied AI that grounds language and vision in actionable world models), and emerging applications in 
    autonomous systems, human-AI collaboration, and adaptive interfaces. Students will understand how free energy 
    minimization provides a principled framework for building AI systems that actively gather information, update 
    beliefs under uncertainty, and select actions that resolve ambiguity—capabilities essential for robust, 
    interpretable, and aligned AI. The course connects theoretical principles to practical implementations, showing 
    how concepts like prediction error minimization, precision-weighted inference, and active sampling manifest in 
    contemporary AI architectures and inform design choices for next-generation systems.
  level: "Professional Development / Graduate"

    Focus on intuitive understanding over mathematical derivation. Emphasize connections between Active Inference 
    principles and familiar AI concepts (attention mechanisms, RLHF, exploration-exploitation, model-based RL). 
    Include concrete examples from current AI systems (LLMs, multimodal models, robotics). Address practical 
    implications for AI development, deployment, and alignment. Connect each theoretical principle to real-world 
    applications in 2025's AI landscape. Suitable for AI practitioners, researchers, and developers seeking 
    principled frameworks for understanding and building adaptive AI systems.
