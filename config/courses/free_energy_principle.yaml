course:
  name: "The Free Energy Principle: From Physics to Mind"
  subject: "Theoretical Neuroscience and Systems Biology"  # Subject/expertise area
  description: |
    An in-depth examination of the Free Energy Principle (FEP), a fundamental principle that proposes that all adaptive 
    systems (biological, cognitive, and even artificial) must minimize a quantity called variational free energy to 
    maintain their structural and functional integrity over time. This course explores how the FEP provides a unified 
    account of life, mind, and behavior by explaining how systems resist the natural tendency toward disorder (entropy) 
    through active engagement with their environment. Students will learn the mathematical foundations of the principle, 
    including its derivation from statistical physics and information theory, the relationship between free energy and 
    entropy, and how minimizing free energy is equivalent to maximizing Bayesian model evidence. The course covers the 
    FEP's application to perception (as Bayesian inference), action (as active inference), learning (as model optimization), 
    and attention (as precision weighting), showing how these processes emerge naturally from the imperative to minimize 
    free energy. Topics include the mathematical formulation of variational free energy and its relationship to surprise 
    and model evidence, the role of generative models in creating predictions about sensory inputs, the hierarchical 
    structure of these models and their temporal dynamics, the distinction between perceptual inference (updating beliefs) 
    and active inference (sampling data), and how the FEP explains phenomena ranging from simple reflexes to complex 
    cognitive behaviors. The course also examines the FEP's implications for understanding biological organization, 
    evolution, development, and pathology, as well as its applications in artificial intelligence, robotics, and 
    therapeutic interventions. Students will explore how the FEP bridges physics, biology, neuroscience, and cognitive 
    science, providing a principled framework for understanding adaptive systems at multiple scales of organization.
