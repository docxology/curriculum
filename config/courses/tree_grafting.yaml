course:
  name: "Tree Grafting: Fundamentals to Advanced Techniques"
  subject: "Horticulture and Plant Propagation"  # Subject/expertise area
  description: |
    A comprehensive course on tree grafting theory and practice, covering the biological principles, 
    techniques, and applications of joining plant tissues to create functional unions between different 
    genetic individuals. Students will learn the fundamental biology of graft compatibility, including 
    cambial alignment, callus formation, and vascular reconnection, as well as the physiological factors 
    that influence graft success such as timing, temperature, and plant vigor. The course progresses from 
    basic techniques (whip-and-tongue, cleft grafting, bark grafting) through intermediate methods 
    (budding, bridge grafting, inarching) to advanced specialized applications (topworking, frameworking, 
    multi-varietal grafting). Students will understand rootstock selection and its effects on tree size, 
    vigor, disease resistance, and environmental adaptation, as well as scion selection for desired fruit 
    quality, growth characteristics, and production traits. The course covers species-specific 
    considerations for fruit trees (apple, pear, stone fruits, citrus), ornamental trees, and specialty 
    applications including rare species propagation and cultivar preservation. Practical topics include 
    tool selection and maintenance, preparing grafting materials, proper storage of scionwood, optimal 
    timing for different techniques, post-graft care and management, troubleshooting failed grafts, and 
    recognizing and addressing graft incompatibility. Students will learn to diagnose common problems 
    such as poor cambial contact, desiccation, disease transmission, and delayed incompatibility. The 
    course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and hands-on skill development, with detailed 
    instruction on knife skills, binding materials, sealing compounds, and environmental management 
    during the healing process. Advanced topics include grafting to control tree architecture, creating 
    family trees with multiple varieties, bench grafting versus field grafting, producing specialty 
    nursery stock, and adapting traditional techniques to contemporary orchard systems and climate 
    challenges. Applications span home orchards, commercial fruit production, ornamental horticulture, 
    germplasm conservation, and specialty plant propagation for research and breeding programs.
  level: "Undergraduate / Professional Development"
  additional_constraints: |
    Balance theoretical biology with practical technique instruction. Include species-specific protocols 
    and regional timing considerations. Emphasize hands-on skill development through detailed procedural 
    guidance and visual references. Progress systematically from simple to complex techniques. Address 
    both why grafts work (biological principles) and how to perform them (practical skills). Include 
    troubleshooting guidance based on common failure modes. Connect traditional practices with current 
    scientific understanding. Incorporate considerations for organic production, climate adaptation, and 
    disease management. Suitable for students pursuing careers in fruit production, nursery operations, 
    landscape horticulture, or advanced home orcharding.
