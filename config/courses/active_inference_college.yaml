  description: |
    A comprehensive undergraduate course on Active Inference, Bayesian statistics, and probabilistic dynamical 
    perception-action systems. This course provides a thorough introduction to how biological and artificial systems 
    use probabilistic reasoning, Bayesian inference, and active engagement with their environment to maintain 
    adaptive behavior. Students will learn the mathematical foundations of Bayesian statistics, including probability 
    theory, conditional probability, Bayes' theorem, and Bayesian inference. The course covers variational methods 
    for approximate Bayesian inference, including variational free energy and its relationship to model evidence 
    and surprise. Students will explore how these statistical principles apply to dynamical systems, where perception 
    and action are coupled through generative models that make predictions about sensory inputs. The course examines 
    how organisms and agents maintain their structural and functional integrity by minimizing variational free energy 
    through both perceptual inference (updating beliefs about hidden states) and active inference (selecting actions 
    that confirm predictions). Topics include the mathematical formulation of probabilistic state-space models, 
    hierarchical generative models, temporal dynamics and Markov processes, the relationship between free energy 
    minimization and Bayesian model selection, precision weighting and attention, policy selection and planning 
    under uncertainty, and model learning through experience. The course connects these theoretical principles to 
    concrete examples from neuroscience (e.g., predictive coding, sensorimotor control), cognitive science (e.g., 
    perception, decision-making, learning), and artificial intelligence (e.g., Bayesian neural networks, 
    reinforcement learning, autonomous agents). Students will gain hands-on experience through computational exercises 
    implementing Bayesian inference, building generative models, simulating perception-action loops, and analyzing 
    how probabilistic systems adapt to changing environments. The course emphasizes both mathematical rigor and 
    intuitive understanding, with extensive use of examples, visualizations, and computational demonstrations to 
    make abstract concepts concrete. Applications span from simple sensorimotor behaviors to complex cognitive 
    processes, showing how probabilistic dynamical systems provide a unified framework for understanding adaptive 
    behavior across scales of organization.
