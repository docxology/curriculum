## Cellular and Molecular Biology: Study Notes

**Introduction:**

Welcome to Cellular and Molecular Biology! This module focuses on understanding the fundamental building blocks of life – cells. We’ll explore the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the functions of key organelles, and the mechanisms governing cellular transport. A solid understanding of these concepts is crucial for comprehending virtually all biological processes.

## Key Concepts:

**Cell Theory**: **Cell Theory**: This fundamental principle states that all living organisms are composed of one or more cells, that the cell is the basic unit of life, and that all cells arise from pre-existing cells. It’s the cornerstone of modern biology, explaining how life emerges and propagates. *Think of it as:* “Cells make life; cells come from cells.”

**Prokaryotic Cell**: **Prokaryotic Cell**: These are simple cells lacking a membrane-bound nucleus and other complex organelles. Their genetic material (DNA) is located in a region called the nucleoid. Examples include bacteria and archaea. *Key features*: Small size, lack of internal membrane-bound organelles, single circular chromosome.

**Eukaryotic Cell**: **Eukaryotic Cell**: These cells are more complex, possessing a membrane-bound nucleus that houses their DNA, along with various membrane-bound organelles that perform specific functions. Examples include animal, plant, fungi, and protist cells. *Key features*: Larger size, presence of a nucleus and organelles like mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum.

**Cell Membrane**: **Cell Membrane**: The outer boundary of a cell, composed primarily of a phospholipid bilayer. It regulates the passage of substances into and out of the cell. *Membrane Function*: Selective permeability – controls what enters and exits the cell.

**Cell Wall**: **Cell Wall**: A rigid layer outside the cell membrane found in plant cells, algae, and fungi. It provides support and protection. *Composition*: Primarily cellulose in plants, chitin in fungi.

**Membrane Potential**: **Membrane Potential**: The difference in electrical charge across the cell membrane. This potential is established by the unequal distribution of ions (charged atoms) across the membrane and is crucial for nerve impulse transmission and nutrient transport. *Think:*  “Like a battery powering cellular activities.”

**Osmosis**: **Osmosis**: The movement of *water* across a semi-permeable membrane (like the cell membrane) from an area of high water concentration to an area of low water concentration. This movement is driven by differences in solute concentration. *Mnemonic*: "Osmosis – Opposite Sides Move."

**ATP**: **ATP**: Adenosine triphosphate, the primary energy currency of cells. It’s a molecule that stores and releases energy to power cellular processes. *Function*: Provides the energy needed for active transport, muscle contraction, and biosynthesis.

**Cell Organelles**: **Cell Organelles**: Specialized sub-cellular structures within eukaryotic cells, each with a distinct function. Examples include mitochondria (energy production), ribosomes (protein synthesis), and the endoplasmic reticulum (protein and lipid synthesis).

**Cell Membrane Structure & Transport:**

The cell membrane is vital for maintaining a stable internal environment.  It allows for selective transport of substances.

*   **Passive Transport**: Movement of substances across the membrane *without* requiring energy input. Examples include diffusion and osmosis.
*   **Active Transport**: Movement of substances across the membrane *requiring* energy input (typically ATP) to overcome concentration gradients.
