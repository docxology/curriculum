**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Explain the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?
**Answer:** Prokaryotic cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles, while eukaryotic cells possess a true nucleus containing DNA and contain membrane-bound organelles. This fundamental distinction underpins many differences in cellular organization and function.

**Question 3:** Which of the following best describes the cell membrane's primary role?
A) Providing structural support to the cell
B) Regulating the movement of substances into and out of the cell
C) Synthesizing proteins
D) Storing genetic information
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The cell membrane, composed of a phospholipid bilayer, controls what enters and exits the cell, maintaining homeostasis through selective permeability. This process is crucial for cell survival and function.

**Question 4:** What is the function of the cell wall in plant cells?
A) To provide energy for the cell
B) To maintain cell shape and protect against damage
C) To transport nutrients throughout the cell
D) To control cell division
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The cell wall provides rigid support, protection, and shape to plant cells, preventing them from bursting due to osmotic pressure. It’s composed primarily of cellulose.

**Question 5:** Passive transport relies on ______ energy, while active transport relies on ______ energy.?
A) Kinetic; potential
B) Chemical; kinetic
C) Potential; kinetic
D) Chemical; potential
**Answer:** D
**Explanation:** Passive transport utilizes the concentration gradient and doesn't require energy, whereas active transport necessitates the input of energy (ATP) to move substances against their gradient.

**Question 6:** What is the main purpose of staining cells during microscopy?
A) To increase cell size
B) To enhance contrast and visibility of cellular structures
C) To make cells transparent
D) To kill the cells
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Staining solutions bind to cellular components, increasing their visibility and allowing for better differentiation and observation of structures under a microscope.

**Question 7:** Describe one specific way the cell membrane controls what enters and exits a cell?
**Answer:** The cell membrane contains transport proteins that facilitate the movement of specific molecules across the membrane. These proteins can be gated or channel proteins, selectively allowing certain substances to pass while blocking others.

**Question 8:** Explain how osmosis contributes to the movement of water across a cell membrane.?
**Answer:** Osmosis is the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane from a region of high water concentration (low solute concentration) to a region of low water concentration (high solute concentration). This movement continues until equilibrium is reached.

**Question 9:** Describe how the discovery of the cell wall contributed to our understanding of plant biology?
**Answer:**  The observation and study of the cell wall revealed the structural complexity of plant cells and how they interact with their environment. It highlighted the importance of cell wall composition, particularly cellulose, in determining plant growth, strength, and responses to external stimuli.

**Question 10:**  Why is it important to use appropriate staining techniques when observing cells under a microscope?
**Answer:** Staining enhances the visibility of cellular structures, such as the nucleus, cell wall, and membrane, making them easier to identify and differentiate under a microscope. Without staining, many cellular components would be difficult or impossible to see clearly.
