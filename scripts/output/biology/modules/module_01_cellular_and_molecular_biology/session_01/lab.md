**Module: Cellular and Molecular Biology**
**Lab Number: 1**
**Lab Focus: Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic Cells**

**1. Brief Background (82 words)**

This laboratory exercise builds upon the foundational concepts introduced in the lecture concerning prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell organization. Students will directly observe and compare the structural features of *Escherichia coli* (a prokaryote) and plant cells (a eukaryote), reinforcing the key differences outlined regarding the presence or absence of a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.  The exercise will provide hands-on experience with microscopy and cell preparation, critical techniques for biological research.

**2. Lab Objectives**

*   Observe and compare the morphology of *E. coli* and plant cells using light microscopy.
*   Identify key structural components of each cell type, including the cell wall, cell membrane, and nucleus (where present).
*   Differentiate between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells based on observed structural features.
*   Utilize staining techniques to enhance visualization of cellular components.
*   Collect quantitative data regarding cell size and shape.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   **Microscopy:**
    *   Light Microscope with 4x, 10x, and 40x objectives
    *   Immersion Oil (Phillips Microscope Grade)
    *   Slide Storage Box
*   **Cell Samples:**
    *   *Escherichia coli* culture (prepared according to [INSTRUCTOR] protocol – approx. 10 mL)
    *   Fresh Elodea (plant cell – approx. 5 cm length)
*   **Staining Solutions:**
    *   Methylene Blue (1% solution in water) – 25 mL
    *   Gram’s Stain (prepared according to [INSTRUCTOR] protocol – available in 10mL bottles)
*   **Miscellaneous:**
    *   Microscope Slides (10 per group)
    *   Cover Slips (10 per group)
    *   Pipettes (10 µL, 100 µL)
    *   Distilled Water
    *   Forceps
    *   Beakers (50 mL, 100 mL)
    *   Timer

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

*   **Biological Hazard:** *E. coli* is a bacteria. Avoid direct contact with the culture.  Use sterile techniques at all times. Dispose of all materials properly according to [INSTRUCTOR] waste disposal protocol.
*   **Chemical Hazard:** Methylene Blue is a dye that can cause skin irritation. Avoid contact with skin and eyes.  Wash hands thoroughly after use.  Handle Gram's stain with care.
*   **Glassware Hazard:** Slides and cover slips can break. Use forceps to handle them.
*   **Time-Sensitive Step:** Gram’s staining must be performed immediately after preparation to prevent distortion.

**5. Procedure**

1.  **Sample Preparation:**  Each group receives a prepared *E. coli* culture and a piece of Elodea.
2.  **Slide Preparation (Elodea):** Place a small section of Elodea onto a clean microscope slide. Add 10 µL of distilled water. Gently lower a cover slip onto the water.
3.  **Staining (Elodea):** Add 10 µL of Methylene Blue to the Elodea slide. Observe for 1 minute.
4.  **Slide Preparation (*E. coli*):** Place a small sample of *E. coli* onto a clean microscope slide. Add 10 µL of distilled water. Gently lower a cover slip onto the water.
5.  **Staining (*E. coli*):** Add 10 µL of Methylene Blue to the *E. coli* slide. Observe for 1 minute.
6.  **Microscopic Observation:**  Using the 4x objective, locate the cells on both slides. Switch to the 10x objective for initial observation.  Switch to the 40x objective for detailed observation.  Use immersion oil with the 40x objective.
7.  **Record Observations:**  Record your observations in the data collection table.

**6. Data Collection**

| Cell Type        | Observation: Cell Shape | Observation: Cell Size (estimate in µm) | Observation: Presence/Absence of Nucleus | Observation: Cell Wall (Color/Texture) |
|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| *E. coli*        |                           |                                         |                                           |                                         |
| Elodea           |                           |                                         |                                           |                                         |

**7. Analysis Questions**

1.  Describe the differences in cell shape and size observed between *E. coli* and Elodea cells.
2.  Explain how the presence or absence of a nucleus contributes to the fundamental difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
3.  What is the role of the cell wall in plant cells (Elodea) and how does it differ from the cell wall's function in bacteria ( *E. coli*)?
4.  How did staining the cells with Methylene Blue enhance your ability to observe cellular structures?
5.  Based on your observations, how could you distinguish between these two cell types?

**8. Expected Results**

Students should observe *E. coli* as rod-shaped bacteria with a relatively small size (approximately 1-2 µm in length). Elodea cells should be larger and more irregularly shaped, exhibiting chloroplasts (green) and a distinct cell wall. The presence of a nucleus will be apparent in the Elodea cells, while *E. coli* will appear to lack a defined nucleus. Staining with Methylene Blue will enhance the visualization of cell structures, notably the nucleus in Elodea and the cell wall in both cell types. Students will be able to confidently distinguish the two cell types based on their morphology and staining characteristics.
