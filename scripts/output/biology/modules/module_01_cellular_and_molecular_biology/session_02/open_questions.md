## Open Question 1: What is the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas13 targeting and degradation of RNA?

Context: CRISPR-Cas13 has emerged as a powerful tool for RNA interference.  Researchers are actively investigating the precise molecular interactions that allow Cas13 to specifically bind to and cleave target RNA molecules. Understanding this process is crucial for improving the specificity and therapeutic potential of RNA-based treatments. Current research focuses on characterizing the structural interactions between Cas13 and its target RNA, and how these interactions are influenced by sequence variations.

## Open Question 2: How does the gut microbiome’s RNA composition influence systemic immune responses?

Context: The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem profoundly impacting human health. Emerging evidence suggests that the RNA transcripts produced by gut bacteria – specifically small RNAs – play a critical role in modulating the immune system. Researchers are exploring how these bacterial RNAs, such as microRNAs, travel through the body and influence immune cell function, with potential implications for inflammatory diseases and vaccine efficacy. Current research utilizes advanced sequencing technologies to map the RNA signatures within the gut microbiome and correlate them with immune responses.

## Open Question 3: What are the implications of single-cell RNA sequencing for understanding tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance?

Context: Traditional cancer diagnostics often rely on bulk tissue analysis, masking the immense diversity within tumors. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers a revolutionary approach by analyzing the RNA expression profiles of individual tumor cells. This allows researchers to identify distinct cell populations, uncover novel biomarkers, and investigate the mechanisms underlying tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance – a major hurdle in cancer treatment. Current research employs sophisticated bioinformatics tools to analyze the vast datasets generated by scRNA-seq and identify drug-resistant clones within the tumor microenvironment.
