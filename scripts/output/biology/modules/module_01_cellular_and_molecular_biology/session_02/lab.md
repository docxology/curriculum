## Cellular and Molecular Biology – Lab 2: Protein Structure

**Module:** Cellular and Molecular Biology
**Lab Number:** 2
**Lab Focus:** Protein Structure (primary, secondary, tertiary)

**Related Topics:** DNA Structure & Replication, Protein Structure (primary, secondary, tertiary), Central Dogma of Molecular Biology

**Learning Objectives:**

**1. Brief Background (98 words)**

Following our exploration of DNA structure and replication, this laboratory exercise will delve into the fascinating world of proteins. Proteins are the workhorses of the cell, responsible for virtually every biological process. Their function is intrinsically linked to their structure, a concept known as structure-function relationship. We will investigate the different levels of protein structure – primary, secondary, and tertiary – focusing on how these levels contribute to a protein's overall shape and ultimately, its ability to perform its specific task. This lab builds directly on our understanding of DNA as the blueprint and proteins as the resulting structures.

**3. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

⚠️ **Chemical Hazards:** Concentrated HCl is corrosive. Avoid contact with skin and eyes. In case of contact, immediately flush with copious amounts of water and seek medical attention.
⚠️ **Thermal Hazards:** Hot plate surfaces can cause burns. Use appropriate heat-resistant gloves and eyewear.
⚠️ **Biological Hazards:** BSA is derived from animal sources.  Handle with standard microbiological practices. Dispose of all solutions in designated biohazard containers.
⚠️ **General Precautions:** Wear appropriate PPE including safety goggles, gloves, and lab coat. Work in a well-ventilated area.

**4. Procedure**

1.  **Preparation:** Label five test tubes as “Tube A”, “Tube B”, “Tube C”, “Tube D”, and “Tube E”.
2.  **Denaturation (Tube A & B):** Add 1.0 mL of 6M HCl to Tube A and Tube B. Gently swirl to mix.
3.  **Reversal of Denaturation (Tube C & D):** Add 1.0 mL of 1M NaCl to Tube C and Tube D. Gently swirl to mix.
4.  **Observation (All Tubes):** Observe the solutions in all five test tubes every 30 seconds for 5 minutes.  Note any changes in turbidity or clarity.
5.  **BSA Sample:** Add 100 µL of the 10 mg/mL BSA solution to each of the five test tubes.
6. **Microscopy (All Tubes):** Prepare a wet mount slide for each of the five test tubes. Observe the samples under the microscope at 40x, noting any visible structures.
7.  **Data Collection:** Record your observations in the data table below.

**6. Analysis Questions**

1.  Describe the changes you observed in Tubes A and B over the 5-minute period. What does this indicate about the structure of BSA?
2.  How did adding NaCl to Tubes C and D affect the appearance of the BSA solution?  Explain the effect of this addition.
3.  What is the role of hydrochloric acid in denaturing the BSA?
4.  What is the primary structure of BSA?  How does the addition of HCl disrupt this primary structure?
5.  How do the changes in solution turbidity relate to the concept of protein folding and the tertiary structure of BSA?

---

**7. Expected Results**

Students should observe that in Tubes A and B, the BSA solution will gradually become more turbid (cloudy) over the 5-minute period. This is due to the unfolding, or denaturation, of the BSA protein. In Tubes C and D, the solution will become clearer as the BSA refolds back into its native, folded conformation. Under the microscope, the BSA solution in Tubes C and D will appear relatively clear with dispersed molecules, while the solutions in Tubes A and B will appear more aggregated and opaque due to the unfolded protein. The addition of HCl causes the protein to unfold, disrupting its secondary and tertiary structure, leading to increased aggregation.
