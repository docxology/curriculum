## Research Question 1: How does the concentration of hydrochloric acid (HCl) affect the rate of protein denaturation, as measured by the loss of the BSA’s characteristic absorbance peak at 280 nm?

**Methodology:** This investigation will utilize a quantitative approach to assess the impact of varying HCl concentrations on BSA protein denaturation.  Five solutions will be prepared, each with a different concentration of HCl (0.1M, 0.2M, 0.3M, 0.4M, and 0.5M). A standard BSA protein solution will be used as the initial sample.  For each HCl concentration, 1 mL of the BSA solution will be mixed with 1 mL of the corresponding HCl solution. The mixture will be gently vortexed for 30 seconds. Immediately after, a spectrophotometer will be used to measure the absorbance at 280 nm. Three replicate measurements will be taken for each solution.  A control group consisting of 1 mL of the BSA solution and 1 mL of distilled water will be included. Data will be recorded in a table and subsequently plotted to generate a graph illustrating the relationship between HCl concentration and absorbance at 280 nm. The change in absorbance will be calculated for each concentration.

**Expected Outcomes:** It is hypothesized that increasing the concentration of HCl will result in a corresponding increase in the rate of BSA denaturation, as evidenced by a decrease in its absorbance at 280 nm. The graph is expected to show a downward trend, indicating that as HCl concentration increases, the absorbance decreases.  The degree of absorbance decrease will be proportional to the HCl concentration, allowing for a quantitative assessment of the denaturation process. A statistically significant correlation between HCl concentration and absorbance change will be demonstrated, providing evidence supporting the hypothesis.  The experiment will illustrate the fundamental principle that changes in pH, driven by the addition of an acid like HCl, can disrupt non-covalent interactions within proteins, leading to conformational changes and, ultimately, denaturation.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of varying incubation times on the extent of protein unfolding, as determined by the change in the absorbance at 280nm?

**Methodology:** This experiment will explore the relationship between incubation time and protein denaturation using BSA. Five different incubation durations will be utilized: 0 minutes (control), 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and 20 minutes.  For each time point, 1 mL of the BSA solution will be mixed with 1 mL of distilled water. The mixture will be gently vortexed for 30 seconds, and then the absorbance at 280 nm will be measured using a spectrophotometer. Three replicate measurements will be taken for each time point, and the average absorbance will be recorded. Data will be organized in a table and plotted on a graph to visualize the progression of denaturation over time.  The change in absorbance will be calculated for each time point to provide a quantitative measure of protein unfolding.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that the BSA protein will undergo denaturation over time, as indicated by a decrease in its absorbance at 280 nm.  The rate of denaturation will likely increase with longer incubation times. The graph should show an upward trend, illustrating that the absorbance at 280 nm increases with time.  The experiment aims to demonstrate that protein denaturation is a time-dependent process, with the magnitude of the change in absorbance directly reflecting the duration of exposure to the destabilizing agent (water in this case). This experiment serves to illustrate the kinetics of protein denaturation.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the extent of protein denaturation using a spectrophotometer?

**Methodology:** This investigation will utilize a spectrophotometer to quantify protein denaturation. A standard BSA solution will be used. The BSA solution will be divided into several groups, with differences in incubation times (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes) and HCl concentrations (0.1M, 0.2M, 0.3M, 0.4M, and 0.5M). In each group, 1 mL of the BSA solution will be mixed with 1 mL of the corresponding solution (water or HCl). The mixture will be gently vortexed for 30 seconds. Immediately after, a spectrophotometer will be used to measure the absorbance at 280 nm. Three replicate measurements will be taken for each solution.  The absorbance readings will be recorded in a table.

**Expected Outcomes:** We expect that as protein denaturation occurs (driven by the incubation conditions), the absorbance at 280nm will decrease. This decrease will be measurable using the spectrophotometer. The data collected will provide a quantitative measure of the change in the BSA’s absorbance due to protein denaturation. This measurement will be used to understand the effect of incubation conditions on protein conformation and stability.
