## Cellular and Molecular Biology: Study Notes

**Introduction:**

Welcome back to Cellular and Molecular Biology. Last week, we explored the fundamental building blocks of the cell – the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and organelles. Today, we delve into two molecules that are absolutely central to life as we know it: DNA and protein. These molecules are intimately intertwined in a process that dictates every aspect of our existence, from our eye color to our susceptibility to disease. Think of DNA as the blueprint, and proteins as the construction workers building the structures according to that blueprint. Understanding their structures and how they interact is the cornerstone of modern biology. For instance, the precise folding of a single protein can dramatically change its function, highlighting the critical link between structure and function.

**Key Concepts:**

**DNA Structure**: DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid is the molecule that carries our genetic instructions. It exists as a double helix, resembling a twisted ladder. The “sides” of the ladder are composed of a sugar-phosphate backbone, a repeating sequence of alternating deoxyribose sugar and phosphate groups. The “rungs” are formed by pairs of nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G).

**Base Pairing**: Base Pairing: Adenine (A) always pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) always pairs with guanine (G). This complementary base pairing is fundamental to DNA replication and maintaining genetic stability. It's like a lock and key mechanism.

**Amino Acids**: Amino Acids: These are the building blocks of proteins. There are 20 standard amino acids, each with a unique chemical structure. They are linked together by peptide bonds to form long chains, which fold into complex three-dimensional structures.

**Protein Structure**: Protein Structure: Proteins have four levels of structure: primary (the linear sequence of amino acids), secondary (local folding patterns like alpha-helices and beta-sheets), tertiary (the overall 3D shape of a single protein), and quaternary (the arrangement of multiple protein subunits).

**Primary Structure**: Primary Structure: The linear sequence of amino acids in a protein. This sequence dictates all subsequent levels of protein structure and ultimately determines the protein’s function.

**Secondary Structure**: Secondary Structure: Local folding patterns of a polypeptide chain, primarily alpha-helices and beta-sheets, stabilized by hydrogen bonds.

**Tertiary Structure**: Tertiary Structure: The overall three-dimensional shape of a single protein, determined by interactions between amino acid side chains. These interactions can include hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and hydrophobic interactions.

**Central Dogma**: Central Dogma: The flow of genetic information follows the pathway: DNA → RNA → Protein. This describes the process of transcription (DNA to RNA) and translation (RNA to protein).

**Transcription & Translation**: Transcription & Translation: Transcription is the process of creating an RNA copy of a DNA sequence. Translation is the process of using the RNA sequence to synthesize a protein, with each three-base-pair codon specifying a particular amino acid.
