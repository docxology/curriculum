**Question 1:** Which of the following best describes the function of DNA’s nitrogenous bases?
A) Catalyzing biochemical reactions
B) Providing structural support for the cell
C) Pairing with complementary bases to store genetic information?
D) Transporting molecules across cell membranes?
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine base pair according to specific rules, forming the foundation of DNA’s double helix and its ability to encode genetic instructions. This base pairing is fundamental to DNA replication and transcription.

**Question 2:** What is the primary component of a protein’s “rungs” in the DNA double helix model?
A) Phosphate groups
B) Sugar-phosphate backbone
C) Amino acid sequences
D) Nitrogenous base pairs?
**Answer:** D
**Explanation:** The “rungs” of the DNA double helix ladder are formed by the complementary pairing of nitrogenous bases – adenine with thymine and cytosine with guanine – which holds the genetic information.

**Question 3:** Which level of protein structure is directly determined by the amino acid sequence?
A) Secondary Structure
B) Tertiary Structure
C) Primary Structure
D) Quaternary Structure?
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The primary structure of a protein is defined solely by the linear order of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds, dictating how the protein will fold.

**Question 4:**  What is the significance of the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology?
A) It describes the process of protein degradation.
B) It outlines the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein?
C) It explains how mutations are introduced into DNA.
D) It details the mechanisms of cell division?
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The Central Dogma describes the unidirectional flow of genetic information - DNA to RNA via transcription and RNA to protein via translation – which is central to gene expression.

**Question 5:**  What is the role of hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the lab exercise?
A) To stabilize protein samples.
B) To denature proteins, unfolding their structure?
C) To measure protein concentration.
D) To act as a buffer solution?
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:**  Hydrochloric acid is used to break down the complex, folded structure of the BSA protein, exposing its primary structure and making it more accessible for analysis.

**Question 6:**  Describe the difference between a prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell in a concise manner?
**Answer:** Prokaryotic cells are simple, smaller cells lacking a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, while eukaryotic cells are more complex, larger cells that possess a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.  These structural differences reflect the differing levels of cellular organization.

**Question 7:** Explain how protein structure is related to protein function?
**Answer:** A protein's shape dictates its ability to interact with other molecules, performing its specific biological role. The intricate folding patterns established by the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures determine the protein's active site and its ability to catalyze reactions, bind to targets, or carry out other essential functions.

**Question 8:**  Discuss a real-world application of understanding protein structure.?
**Answer:** The development of targeted drug therapies relies heavily on understanding protein structure. By knowing the precise 3D shape of a protein involved in a disease (e.g., an enzyme involved in cancer), scientists can design drugs that specifically bind to that protein and inhibit its activity, thereby treating the disease.

**Question 9:** Integrate your understanding of DNA replication and protein structure in a single explanation.?
**Answer:** DNA replication ensures the accurate duplication of genetic information through base pairing rules, while protein structure emerges as the consequence of this replication process. The ordered sequence of amino acids within a protein, dictated by the transcribed RNA, establishes the 3D shape responsible for its specific function – demonstrating the critical link between genetic information and biological activity.
