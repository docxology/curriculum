## Organisms and Processes – Study Notes

**Introduction**

Welcome back to Organisms and Processes. Last week, we explored how organisms maintain homeostasis through regulated internal environments. Today, we delve into two fundamental processes that underpin life as we know it: cellular respiration and photosynthesis. These processes are inextricably linked; photosynthesis captures solar energy and converts it into chemical energy, while cellular respiration breaks down that energy to fuel cellular activities. Understanding these pathways is crucial for appreciating the flow of energy within ecosystems and the intricate workings of living organisms. Think of it like a factory: photosynthesis is the production line, and cellular respiration is the utilization of the product.

**Key Concepts:**

**ATP**: Adenosine triphosphate, the primary energy currency of cells, composed of adenosine and three phosphate groups. This molecule stores energy in its bonds, which can be released to power cellular work.

**Glycolysis**: Ten-step metabolic pathway that converts glucose to pyruvate, producing 2 ATP molecules and NADH. This initial breakdown occurs in the cytoplasm and doesn’t require oxygen.

**Krebs Cycle**: A cyclical metabolic pathway occurring in the mitochondrial matrix, oxidizing acetyl-CoA to generate ATP, NADH, and FADH2 – all vital for the electron transport chain.

**Electron Transport Chain**: A series of protein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane, utilizing electrons from NADH and FADH2 to generate a proton gradient and ultimately produce a large amount of ATP.

**Photosynthesis**: The process by which plants and some bacteria use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to synthesize glucose and oxygen. It is divided into light-dependent and light-independent reactions.

**Light Absorption**: The capture of photons (light energy) by pigments such as chlorophyll, initiating the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis.

**Redox Reactions**: Chemical reactions involving the transfer of electrons, where one molecule is oxidized (loses electrons) and another is reduced (gains electrons). These reactions are fundamental to both photosynthesis and cellular respiration.

**Mitochondrial Matrix**: The inner compartment of the mitochondria where the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain take place.

**Light-Dependent Reactions**: The initial phase of photosynthesis, occurring in the thylakoid membranes, where light energy is converted into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH.

**Dark Reactions (Calvin Cycle)**: The second phase of photosynthesis, occurring in the stroma of the chloroplasts, where ATP and NADPH are used to fix carbon dioxide into glucose.

**NADH**: A coenzyme crucial for electron transfer in the subsequent stages of cellular respiration, carrying high-energy electrons. It's often referred to as "Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Hydrogen."

**Cellular Respiration – Extracting Energy from Glucose**

Cellular respiration is the process by which organisms break down organic molecules, primarily glucose, to release energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). ATP is the primary energy currency of the cell, powering virtually all cellular activities. There are several stages to cellular respiration, each contributing to the overall ATP yield. Let’s examine the key stages.

### 1.1 Glycolysis – The Initial Breakdown

Glycolysis, meaning “sugar splitting,” occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. It’s the initial breakdown of glucose (a six-carbon molecule) into two molecules of pyruvate (a three-carbon molecule). This process doesn’t require oxygen and yields a small amount of ATP (2 molecules) and NADH (a reduced coenzyme carrying high-energy electrons).  To remember this, consider the mnemonic "G**L**ucose **L**eads to **P**yruvate” (Glycolysis produces Pyruvate).

### 1.2 Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle) – Further Oxidation

The Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle, takes place in the mitochondrial matrix. It’s a cyclical pathway where acetyl-CoA (derived from pyruvate) is completely oxidized, generating ATP, NADH, and FADH2. FADH2 is another electron carrier. This cycle further releases energy from glucose.

### 1.3 Electron Transport Chain – ATP Synthesis

The electron transport chain is the final stage of cellular respiration. It utilizes the electrons carried by NADH and FADH2 to generate a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This gradient drives ATP synthesis through a process called chemiosmosis. This stage generates the bulk of ATP produced during cellular respiration.

**Photosynthesis – Capturing Energy from Sunlight**

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and some bacteria use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to synthesize glucose and oxygen. It's divided into two main stages: light-dependent and light-independent reactions.

### 2.1 Light-Dependent Reactions – Initial Energy Capture

The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. Here, light energy is absorbed by pigments like chlorophyll, exciting electrons. This energy is then used to split water molecules, generating oxygen as a byproduct. The energized electrons move through an electron transport chain, ultimately producing ATP and NADPH.

### 2.2 Dark Reactions (Calvin Cycle) – Glucose Production

The light-independent reactions, or Calvin cycle, occur in the stroma of the chloroplasts. This cycle uses the ATP and NADPH generated during the light-dependent reactions to fix carbon dioxide into glucose.  It’s a cyclical process that converts inorganic carbon into organic sugar.
