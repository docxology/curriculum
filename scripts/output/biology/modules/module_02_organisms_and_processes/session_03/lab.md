**Lab Focus: Electron Transport Chain**

**1. Brief Background (87 words)**

Following our exploration of glycolysis, we now focus on the final stages of cellular respiration – the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. This series of reactions utilizes the high-energy electrons generated during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle to produce a significantly larger amount of ATP. The electron transport chain, located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, harnesses the potential energy of these electrons to pump protons across the membrane, creating a proton gradient. This gradient drives ATP synthesis through a process called oxidative phosphorylation. This lab will demonstrate the fundamental principles of this vital energy-producing pathway.

**2. Lab Objectives:**

*   Observe the formation of a visible pH gradient across the membrane.
*   Measure the change in voltage across a membrane using a voltmeter.
*   Determine the relationship between proton gradient and ATP production.
*   Collect data to support the role of the electron transport chain in ATP synthesis.
*   Analyze the factors influencing the efficiency of the electron transport chain.

**3. Materials and Equipment:**

*   **Solutions:**
    *   Sodium Bicarbonate Solution (0.1 M) – 100 mL
    *   Yeast Suspension (5% w/v) – 50 mL
    *   Starch Solution (1% w/v) – 50 mL
    *   Hydrogen Peroxide (3% w/v) – 50 mL
    *   Buffer Solution (pH 7.4) - 100 mL
*   **Equipment:**
    *   Test Tubes (10) – 75 mL capacity
    *   Voltmeter (Digital, with 0.01 V resolution)
    *   Connecting Wires & Clips (for voltmeter)
    *   Beakers (100 mL, 5)
    *   Graduated Cylinders (10 mL, 2)
    *   Thermometer
    *   Stirring Rods (x3)
    *   Ice Bath
    *   Timer

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

*   **Chemical Hazards:** Hydrogen peroxide is a corrosive substance. Avoid contact with skin and eyes. [INSTRUCTOR] – Ensure students handle hydrogen peroxide with extreme care.
*   **Biological Hazard:** While the yeast suspension is generally safe, practice proper aseptic technique to prevent contamination.
*   **Physical Hazard:** Use caution when handling glassware to prevent breakage.  Be aware of potential heat buildup during the reaction. Wear safety goggles at all times.  [INSTRUCTOR] - Dispose of all solutions properly according to laboratory protocol.
*   **Time-Sensitive:** Maintain the ice bath throughout the reaction to maintain a low temperature.

**5. Procedure:**

1.  **Preparation:** Label five test tubes as “Control,” “Low Temperature,” “High Temperature,” “Yeast 1” and “Yeast 2”.
2.  **Control Setup:** To each test tube, add 20 mL of buffer solution.
3.  **Yeast Introduction:** To “Yeast 1” and “Yeast 2”, add 5 mL of yeast suspension. To “Control” and “High Temperature”, add 5 mL of buffer solution.
4.  **Temperature Control:** To “Low Temperature,” place the test tube in an ice bath for 5 minutes prior to the experiment. To “High Temperature”, heat the test tube in a warm water bath (37°C) for 5 minutes.
5.  **Starch Addition:** To all test tubes, add 5 mL of starch solution.
6.  **Observation:** Observe the test tubes for 10 minutes, noting any color changes (specifically the disappearance of the blue-black color due to the breakdown of starch). Record observations.
7.  **Voltmeter Measurement:**  Attach the voltmeter probes to the test tubes. Record the voltage reading every 2 minutes for 10 minutes.
8.  **Repeat:** Repeat steps 1-7 with a fresh set of materials.

**6. Data Collection:**

| Time (minutes) | Temperature (°C) | Voltage (V) – Reading 1 | Voltage (V) – Reading 2 | Observations (Color change, Bubble formation, etc.)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 22 |  |  |  |
| 2 | 22 |  |  |  |
| 4 | 22 |  |  |  |
| 6 | 22 |  |  |  |
| 8 | 22 |  |  |  |
| 10 | 22 |  |  |  |
| 12 | 22 |  |  |  |
| 14 | 22 |  |  |  |
| 16 | 22 |  |  |  |
| 18 | 22 |  |  |  |

**7. Analysis Questions:**

1.  How did the temperature affect the rate of starch breakdown? Explain your observations.
2.  What role did the yeast play in this experiment? How did it contribute to the process?
3.  How did the voltage readings change over time? What does this indicate about energy production?
4.  Describe the relationship between the proton gradient and the generation of ATP.
5.  How does this experiment demonstrate the fundamental principles of the electron transport chain?

**8. Expected Results:**

Students should observe a gradual disappearance of the blue-black color from the starch solution in all test tubes as the experiment progresses. The voltage readings will increase over time, particularly in the test tubes with yeast, reflecting the production of ATP. The control tube should show minimal change. The highest voltage should be observed in the test tube with yeast, demonstrating that the enzyme activity of the yeast facilitates the electron transport chain.
