are three open-ended research questions designed to represent current frontiers, formatted exactly as specified.

## Open Question 1: What are the specific mechanisms driving the observed resistance to commonly used antibiotics in *Staphylococcus aureus* biofilms?

Context: The rise of antibiotic-resistant *S. aureus* is a major global health threat. *S. aureus* biofilms are notoriously difficult to eradicate, contributing significantly to persistent infections. Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms governing this resistance is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Current research focuses on identifying novel virulence factors and resistance pathways within these biofilms.

## Open Question 2: How does the gut microbiome composition influence the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in treating inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)?

Context: FMT has demonstrated promising results in treating IBD, but the extent to which specific bacterial communities contribute to its success remains unclear. Research is exploring the complex interactions between the gut microbiome and the host immune system. Precise understanding of these relationships will allow for tailored FMT protocols and potentially, microbiome-based therapies. Current research investigates the diversity and function of bacterial populations in successful FMT recipients.

## Open Question 3: What is the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in modulating the immune response during acute organ transplantation?

Context: MSC-derived EVs are increasingly recognized for their therapeutic potential in transplantation. However, the exact mechanisms by which these EVs influence the recipient's immune system – specifically, whether they promote tolerance or exacerbate rejection – require further investigation. Current research employs advanced techniques like single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the effects of EVs on immune cell populations at the graft site.
