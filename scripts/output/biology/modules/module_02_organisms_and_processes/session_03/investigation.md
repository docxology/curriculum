Okay, here’s a set of three research questions, formatted precisely as requested, along with detailed methodologies and expected outcomes, aiming for 150-200 words per investigation.

## Research Question 1: How does the initial concentration of glucose affect the rate of glycolysis in yeast?

**Methodology:** This investigation will utilize *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (baker’s yeast) to explore the relationship between glucose concentration and the rate of glycolysis.  A population of yeast will be prepared in a sterile environment.  Three experimental groups will be established: a control group (no added glucose), a low-glucose group (0.5g/L), and a high-glucose group (1.0g/L).  Each group will be incubated in a glucose-rich solution at 37°C. The rate of glycolysis will be determined by measuring the volume of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced over a fixed 30-minute period using a gas collection apparatus. Measurements will be repeated three times for each group.  Temperature and pH will be carefully monitored and maintained.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate observing a positive correlation between glucose concentration and the rate of CO2 production. The high-glucose group is expected to demonstrate a significantly higher CO2 production rate compared to the control and low-glucose groups. This supports the understanding that increased substrate availability (glucose) directly drives the rate of the glycolytic pathway. The experiment will demonstrate that glycolysis is a directly proportional reaction to initial glucose levels.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of varying temperatures on the rate of ATP production in yeast mitochondria?

**Methodology:** This research will investigate the impact of temperature on ATP production within yeast mitochondria. A controlled experiment will involve preparing a yeast suspension and incubating it at four different temperatures: 25°C, 37°C, 42°C, and 47°C. Each temperature will be maintained using a water bath. The rate of ATP production will be assessed by measuring oxygen consumption using a Clark-type oxygen electrode. The electrode’s output will be recorded continuously for 20 minutes. Measurements will be taken at regular intervals (every 5 minutes). Strict control of other variables, such as pH and ionic strength, will be maintained. Three replicates will be performed for each temperature.

**Expected Outcomes:** It is predicted that ATP production will increase until reaching an optimum temperature (likely around 37°C) and then decline as the temperature becomes too high, damaging the enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation.  A steeper decline is expected at the higher temperature, indicating that the increased thermal energy disrupts the delicate processes within the mitochondria. The data will illustrate the importance of maintaining an optimal temperature range for efficient energy generation.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the efficiency of ATP synthesis within yeast mitochondria?

**Methodology:** To quantify ATP synthesis, this experiment will employ a spectrophotometric method. Yeast suspensions will be prepared and incubated in a buffer solution containing glucose.  The spectrophotometer will measure the absorbance of the solution at 340 nm – a wavelength associated with the oxidation of NADH, a key intermediate in the electron transport chain.  The rate of NADH oxidation will be correlated with the rate of ATP production.  Furthermore, samples will be supplemented with an inhibitor of the electron transport chain to assess the pathway’s contribution to ATP synthesis. The spectrophotometric readings will be recorded continuously for 30 minutes.

**Expected Outcomes:**  We anticipate a strong positive correlation between the rate of NADH oxidation (as measured by spectrophotometry) and the measured ATP production. The addition of an electron transport chain inhibitor will significantly reduce the spectrophotometric signal, indicating that the electron transport chain is essential for generating ATP. This experiment will provide a quantitative measurement of the efficiency of ATP synthesis within yeast mitochondria, providing data to support the understanding of this critical metabolic pathway.
