**Lab Focus: Feedback Mechanisms**

**1. Brief Background (87 words)**

Following our discussion on energy transformations and cellular respiration, we’ve established the fundamental role of homeostasis in maintaining stable internal conditions for organisms. This lab will explore the mechanisms by which organisms, like the desert lizard, actively regulate their internal environments. Specifically, we will investigate a simple, observable feedback system – temperature regulation in a biological system. Students will analyze how changes in an external stimulus (temperature) trigger responses within the organism, ultimately maintaining a stable internal state.

**2. Lab Objectives (4 bullet points)**

*   Observe and record changes in temperature in a biological system.
*   Identify the physiological responses of [ORGANISM NAME - e.g., Elodea] to temperature fluctuations.
*   Analyze data to determine if the observed responses represent negative feedback.
*   Predict the effects of continued temperature changes on the biological system.
*   Construct a data table to organize and interpret experimental observations.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   Elodea sprigs (approx. 10 cm long) – 1 per group
*   Beakers (100 mL) – 3 per group
*   Distilled Water – 300 mL per group
*   Thermometers (digital) – 1 per group
*   Ice – 100 g
*   Warm Water Bath (can be created using a hot plate set to 40°C – [INSTRUCTOR] – *Monitor closely*)
*   Timer / Stopwatch
*   Forceps
*   Gloves (latex) – 1 pair per group
*   Lab Coats - 1 per group
*   Safety Goggles – 1 per student

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

⚠️ **Biological Hazard:** *Elodea* may contain microorganisms.  Avoid ingestion and wash hands thoroughly after handling.
⚠️ **Thermal Hazard:**  The warm water bath will be maintained at 40°C. *Avoid direct contact with the warm water bath. Use tongs or forceps to handle any materials submerged in the warm water.* [INSTRUCTOR] - *Constant temperature monitoring is essential.*
⚠️ **Glassware Hazard:** Use caution when handling glassware to prevent cuts.
⚠️ **General Lab Safety:**  Follow all standard laboratory safety procedures.

**5. Procedure (6 steps)**

1.  Divide students into groups of [3-4] students.
2.  Each group receives a beaker, Elodea sprig, thermometer, and forceps.
3.  Place one Elodea sprig into each beaker containing 50 mL of distilled water.
4.  Set up the warm water bath at 40°C.  Allow the Elodea in three beakers to acclimatize to this temperature for 5 minutes.
5.  Using the timer, monitor the temperature of the water in the beakers.  Record the temperature every 30 seconds for 5 minutes.  Maintain the temperature constant by adding small amounts of ice to the water as needed to reduce the temperature.
6.  Observe the Elodea in each beaker. Record any visible changes, such as increased movement, bubbling, or discoloration, in the data table.

**6. Data Collection**

| Time (seconds) | Temperature (°C) | Observation of Elodea (e.g., Movement, Bubbling, Color) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | [INSTRUCTOR] - Initial Temperature | None |
| 30 | [INSTRUCTOR] - Record Temperature |  |
| 60 | [INSTRUCTOR] - Record Temperature |  |
| 90 | [INSTRUCTOR] - Record Temperature |  |
| 120 | [INSTRUCTOR] - Record Temperature |  |
| 150 | [INSTRUCTOR] - Record Temperature |  |
| 180 | [INSTRUCTOR] - Record Temperature |  |

**7. Analysis Questions (4 questions)**

1.  Describe the relationship between the temperature of the water and the observed changes in the Elodea.
2.  Did the Elodea’s responses demonstrate a positive or negative feedback mechanism? Justify your answer based on your data.
3.  If the temperature were to continue to rise, what further responses might you expect to observe from the Elodea?
4.  How does this simple experiment illustrate the concept of homeostasis in biological systems?

**8. Expected Results (2 paragraphs)**

Students should observe that as the water temperature increases, the Elodea sprigs will exhibit increased movement (wrinkling of the cut end) and potentially increased bubbling (oxygen release).  The increased movement is a physiological response to the higher temperature, attempting to maintain a stable internal temperature.  The bubbling indicates increased cellular respiration, driven by the need to generate heat to counteract the external temperature rise, demonstrating a negative feedback mechanism.  The system is actively working to maintain stability.  Data should show a clear trend of movement and bubbling correlating with increased temperature.
