Okay, here’s the formatted research question set and investigation plans, adhering strictly to the provided requirements and formatting guidelines.

## Research Question 1: How does the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) in aquatic environments affect the photosynthetic rate of *Elodea* plants?

**Methodology:**
This investigation will use a controlled experimental design.  Three groups of *Elodea* plants will be established in beakers containing identical volumes of water.  Group 1 (control) will have standard tap water. Group 2 will have water with a low CO2 concentration (0.5 mg/L), created by bubbling air through a small quantity of sodium bicarbonate.  Group 3 will have water with a high CO2 concentration (1.0 mg/L) also generated by sodium bicarbonate. The experiment will run for 60 minutes.  The photosynthetic rate will be quantified by measuring the volume of oxygen produced (a byproduct of photosynthesis) as bubbles.  This will be done periodically (every 15 minutes) and recorded.  Temperature will be carefully controlled and monitored throughout the experiment to minimize its impact on the rate of photosynthesis. Light intensity will also be standardized.  A clear measurement is made at each interval.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that the photosynthetic rate will increase with increasing CO2 concentration up to a certain point.  The control group (0 CO2) will exhibit a baseline photosynthetic rate. The group with the higher CO2 concentration will likely show a significantly higher photosynthetic rate, assuming sufficient light and nutrients. The results will be analyzed statistically (e.g., ANOVA) to determine if the differences in oxygen production are significant. Data will be presented graphically (e.g., line graphs) to illustrate the relationship between CO2 concentration and photosynthetic rate.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of varying light intensity on the growth rate of *Lemna* (duckweed)?

**Methodology:**
This investigation will assess the impact of light intensity on the growth of *Lemna* (duckweed).  Four groups of duckweed will be established in Petri dishes containing identical nutrient solutions. Each group will be placed under a different light intensity – low (200 lux), medium (400 lux), high (600 lux), and a dark control (covered with foil). The Petri dishes will be maintained at a constant temperature (22°C) and humidity. The number of duckweed fronds in each group will be counted and recorded every 24 hours for 7 days.  Measurements of frond size (length and width) will also be taken weekly using a ruler for a more precise assessment of growth. The frequency of measurements is set at daily to track changes quickly.

**Expected Outcomes:** We predict that the growth rate of *Lemna* will increase with increasing light intensity, up to a saturation point. The group exposed to the highest light intensity will exhibit the greatest growth in terms of both frond number and size. The dark control group will show minimal or no growth. The data will be presented as graphs showing the growth rate of the duckweed fronds over time.  The results will be interpreted to understand the optimal light intensity for *Lemna* growth.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the impact of varying salinity on the survival rate of *Artemia* (brine shrimp)?

**Methodology:**
This investigation will explore the effects of salinity on the survival rate of *Artemia* (brine shrimp) larvae. Five experimental groups will be established, each containing 50 *Artemia* larvae in separate beakers. Each beaker will receive identical artificial seawater, but with varying salinity levels: 10 ppt, 20 ppt, 30 ppt, 40 ppt, and 50 ppt. The beakers will be kept at a constant temperature (25°C) and under continuous illumination. The number of surviving *Artemia* larvae in each group will be counted daily for 7 days.  Observations of larval behavior (movement, feeding) will also be recorded. The experimental design minimizes bias by using a sufficiently large sample size.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that the survival rate of *Artemia* will decline as salinity increases, due to osmotic stress. The group with the lowest salinity (10 ppt) is predicted to have the highest survival rate, while the group with the highest salinity (50 ppt) will likely have the lowest. The data will be presented graphically as a line graph to demonstrate the relationship between salinity and survival rate. This investigation can be expanded to test the effect of specific ions.
