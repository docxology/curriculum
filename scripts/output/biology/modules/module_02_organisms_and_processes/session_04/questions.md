**Question 1:** Which of the following best describes homeostasis?
A) A state of constant, unchanging environmental conditions.
B) The ability of an organism to rapidly adapt to any external change.
C) The maintenance of a relatively stable internal environment.
D) The process of organisms consuming energy to grow and reproduce?
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Homeostasis refers to the dynamic equilibrium an organism maintains by regulating internal conditions like temperature and pH, despite external fluctuations, ensuring optimal functioning.

**Question 2:** What is the primary function of ribosomes within a cell?
A) Storage of genetic information.
B) Synthesis of proteins.
C) Breakdown of cellular waste products.
D) Transport of molecules across the cell membrane?
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Ribosomes are responsible for translating mRNA into proteins, a fundamental process essential for cell structure and function, utilizing genetic code.

**Question 3:**  How does negative feedback primarily contribute to maintaining stability in a biological system?
A) It amplifies the initial stimulus.
B) It counteracts the changes occurring in the system.
C) It completely eliminates external influences.
D) It only affects large, complex organisms?
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Negative feedback loops work to reduce or reverse a change, returning the system to its set point – like the body’s cooling mechanism when it gets too hot.

**Question 4:** What is the significance of symbiosis in ecological relationships?
A) It always results in one species dominating the other.
B) It highlights the interdependence and interactions between different species.
C) It is a completely random process with no underlying principles.
D) It only occurs between animals and plants?
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Symbiosis encompasses various interactions, such as mutualism and commensalism, showcasing how species rely on each other for survival and influencing ecosystem dynamics.

**Question 5:**  Which of the following is a key characteristic of eukaryotic cells?
A) They possess a cell wall for structural support.
B) They contain a nucleus where their genetic material is housed.
C) They are significantly smaller than prokaryotic cells.
D) They rely solely on diffusion for nutrient transport?
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Eukaryotic cells are defined by having a membrane-bound nucleus, enclosing the cell's DNA, a crucial distinction from prokaryotic cells that lack this structure.

**Question 6:**  Describe, in 2-3 sentences, the role of enzymes in biological processes?
**Answer:** Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions within cells. They achieve this by lowering the activation energy required for a reaction to occur, without being consumed themselves.

**Question 7:** Explain, in 2-3 sentences, how competition influences ecological relationships?
**Answer:** Competition occurs when organisms vie for the same limited resources, like food, water, or space. This drives evolutionary adaptations and can determine the population sizes of different species within a given environment.

**Question 8:**  Discuss, in 2-3 sentences, the concept of biodiversity and its importance for ecosystem stability?
**Answer:** Biodiversity refers to the variety of life forms within an ecosystem, encompassing genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity. A high level of biodiversity increases ecosystem resilience to disturbances and supports essential ecosystem services.

**Question 9:**  Considering the lab exercise involving Elodea and temperature, predict, in 2-3 sentences, what would happen to the rate of photosynthesis if the temperature were continuously increased?
**Answer:**  Increasing the temperature would generally accelerate the rate of photosynthesis in Elodea up to a certain point. However, excessive heat would eventually denature enzymes involved in photosynthesis, thus decreasing the rate due to impaired enzyme function.
