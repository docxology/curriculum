## Organisms and Processes – Study Notes

**Homeostasis**: The maintenance of a relatively stable internal environment within an organism, despite external fluctuations. This regulation is essential for optimal cellular function. Homeostasis isn't a static state, but rather a dynamic equilibrium – a constant process of adjustment. Organisms achieve this through a variety of feedback mechanisms.

**Concept Name**: Homeostasis : Maintaining internal stability is crucial for cell function, allowing organisms to survive changing conditions. Think of it like a thermostat controlling a room's temperature.

**Concept Name**: Feedback Mechanisms : Processes that help organisms maintain a stable internal environment. These mechanisms can be positive or negative.

**Concept Name**: Negative Feedback : A regulatory system that counteracts a change, returning a system to its set point. It’s the most common type and operates like a thermostat. Examples include temperature regulation and blood glucose control.

**Concept Name**: Positive Feedback : A regulatory system that amplifies a change, moving the system further away from its set point. This is less common than negative feedback and often involves a rapid, dramatic response. An example is childbirth – the initial contractions stimulate more contractions.

**Concept Name**: Population Dynamics : The study of changes in the size and structure of populations over time. Factors influencing population size include birth rates, death rates, immigration, and emigration.

**Concept Name**: Species Interactions : The relationships between different species within an ecosystem. These interactions can be competitive, predatory, symbiotic, or parasitic.

**Concept Name**: Ecological Niche : The specific role a species plays within its ecosystem, including its resource requirements and interactions with other species. It’s essentially a species’ “job” in the environment.

**Concept Name**: Symbiosis : A close and often long-term interaction between two different biological species. There are three main types: mutualism (both benefit), commensalism (one benefits, the other is unaffected), and parasitism (one benefits, the other is harmed).

**Concept Name**: Competition : An interaction between organisms or species in which they compete for the same limited resources, such as food, water, or territory.

**Concept Name**: Biodiversity : The variety of life on Earth at all its levels, from genes to ecosystems. It’s a measure of the richness and abundance of species in a given area.

**Concept Name**: Ecosystem : A community of living organisms (biotic factors) interacting with their physical environment (abiotic factors). Ecosystems are dynamic and constantly changing.

**Concept Name**: Thermoregulation : The process by which organisms maintain a constant internal body temperature. This is essential for enzyme function and overall metabolic processes. Mechanisms include sweating, shivering, and insulation.
