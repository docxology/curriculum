## Open Question 1: What is the role of the microbiome in modulating wound healing responses?

Context: Wound healing is increasingly recognized as a complex, dynamic process influenced by the surrounding microbial community. Current research suggests that specific bacterial species can either promote or hinder the resolution of inflammation and tissue regeneration. Understanding the precise interactions between the microbiome and host immune cells is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies.

## Open Question 2: How do epigenetic modifications influence the long-term stability of scar tissue formation?

Context: Scar tissue development is often considered a static outcome, but emerging evidence demonstrates that epigenetic mechanisms – DNA methylation, histone modification – play a significant role in determining the quality and stability of the scar. Research is exploring whether epigenetic changes can be targeted to reshape scar tissue, minimizing fibrosis and improving tissue function.

## Open Question 3: What are the implications of circulating exosome communication for systemic wound inflammation?

Context: Recent studies have revealed that damaged tissues release exosomes – tiny vesicles containing RNA and proteins – which can travel throughout the body, influencing distant sites of inflammation. Investigating the role of exosomes in propagating inflammatory signals during wound healing is vital for understanding the potential for systemic inflammatory responses and designing effective anti-inflammatory interventions.
