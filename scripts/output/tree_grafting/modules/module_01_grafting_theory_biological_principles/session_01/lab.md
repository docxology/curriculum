## Lab Focus: Cambial Zone Definition

**Module: Grafting Theory & Biological Principles – Lab 1**
**Lab Number: 1**
**Lab Focus: Cambial Zone Definition**

**1. Brief Background (87 words)**

This laboratory exercise builds upon the lecture’s introduction to grafting theory, specifically focusing on the role of cambial activity. Students will directly observe and define the cambial zone within a woody plant stem. Understanding the cambium's active cell division is fundamental to grasping how wounds are healed and subsequently, how grafting can be successfully achieved. The exercise will emphasize the link between disrupted cambial activity and the subsequent wound response phases, providing a practical demonstration of this core botanical concept. [INSTRUCTOR: Briefly review the lecture content.]

**2. Lab Objectives (4 bullet points)**

*   Identify the cambial zone within a woody plant stem.
*   Quantify the width of the cambial zone.
*   Describe the appearance and cellular structure of the cambial zone under a microscope.
*   Record observations regarding changes within the cambial zone following a wound induction.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   **Plant Material:** 10 pea (Pisum sativum) seedlings, approximately 8-12 cm tall, grown in peat pots.
*   **Sharp Instruments:** 2 x Utility Knives (with blunt tips – safety feature).
*   **Microscope Slides & Coverslips:** 20 slides, 20 coverslips.
*   **Microscope:** Compound Microscope with 4x, 10x, and 40x objectives.
*   **Distilled Water:** 50 mL
*   **Petri Dishes:** 10 small Petri Dishes (90mm diameter)
*   **Forceps:** Sterile forceps, 2 sets.
*   **Ruler:** Metric ruler (100mm and 300mm).
*   **Paper Towels:** Sterile paper towels.
*   **Magnifying Glass:** Hand lens (10x).

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

*   ⚠️ **Sharp Object Hazard:** Utility knives are extremely sharp. Use with extreme caution. Keep fingers well away from the cutting edge. [INSTRUCTOR: Demonstrate proper knife handling techniques – slow, deliberate cuts.]
*   ⚠️ **Biological Hazard:** Plant material may contain microorganisms. Avoid touching your mouth or face. Dispose of plant material properly after the experiment.
*   ⚠️ **Eye Protection:** Safety goggles *must* be worn at all times during this exercise.
*   ⚠️ **Microbial Contamination:**  Work surfaces should be cleaned with 70% isopropyl alcohol before and after the exercise.
*   ⚠️ **Time-Sensitive Step:** Cutting operations should be performed swiftly and accurately to minimize potential injury.

**5. Procedure (7 steps)**

1.  **Preparation:** Each student will receive one pea seedling, a utility knife, a Petri dish, and a ruler.
2.  **Wound Induction:** Using the utility knife, carefully make a shallow, oblique cut (approximately 1 cm long) into the stem of your pea seedling, approximately 2 cm from the base. Maintain a slow, deliberate cutting motion.
3.  **Observation (Gross):** Immediately after cutting, examine the wound area using the hand lens. Note any initial changes – discoloration, swelling, cellular activity. Record your observations qualitatively.
4.  **Slide Preparation (Microscopic):** Using sterile forceps, gently scrape a small amount of the wounded tissue (approximately 0.5 mm in diameter) onto a microscope slide. Add 10 μL of distilled water. Cover with a coverslip.
5.  **Microscopic Observation:**  Observe the wound site under the 4x and 10x objectives.  Then, using the 40x objective, carefully examine the cellular structure of the cambial zone – note the arrangement and appearance of dividing cells.
6.  **Repeat:** Repeat steps 1-5 with a second seedling.
7.  **Cleanup:** Dispose of plant material and slides according to laboratory protocols. Clean work surfaces with 70% isopropyl alcohol.

**6. Data Collection**

| Observation Category | Seedling 1 (Initial) | Seedling 1 (45 min post-cut) | Seedling 2 (Initial) | Seedling 2 (45 min post-cut) |
|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Wound Appearance      |                      |                           |                      |                           |
| Cambial Zone Width (mm) |                      |                           |                      |                           |
| Cell Size/Shape (qualitative) |                      |                           |                      |                           |

**7. Analysis Questions (5 bullet points)**

*   What is the primary function of the cambial zone?
*   Describe the appearance of the cambial zone and how it differs from the surrounding tissue.
*   How does the width of the cambial zone relate to plant growth?
*   How does the appearance of the cambial zone change over time following wound induction?
*   Explain how the disruption of cambial activity contributes to the plant’s wound healing response.

**8. Expected Results (6 points)**

Students should observe a noticeable discoloration (reddish/purplish) and swelling at the wound site within 15-45 minutes due to increased vascular activity. The cambial zone will appear as a clearly defined layer of actively dividing cells, often appearing darker and more densely packed than surrounding tissue. Under the microscope, cell division should be visible as small, elongated cells. The width of the cambial zone should be approximately 0.1-0.3 mm. Cell size will be smaller in the cambial zone. Over 45 minutes, the redness may lessen.  [INSTRUCTOR: Monitor student progress and provide feedback on their observations.]
