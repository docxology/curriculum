## Research Question 1: How does the duration of initial wound inflammation affect the subsequent formation of a vascularized callus in *Arabidopsis thaliana*?

**Methodology:**  This investigation will employ a controlled experiment utilizing *Arabidopsis thaliana* seedlings. Seedlings will be divided into three groups (n=30 per group). Group 1 (Control) will experience a standardized wound induced with a small circular excision. Group 2 will experience a wound followed by a 24-hour period of initial inflammation, mirroring a typical early response. Group 3 will experience a wound followed by a 48-hour period of inflammation. At 72 hours post-injury, callus tissue samples will be collected from each group.  Callus tissue samples will be analyzed using histological staining (Masson’s trichrome) to assess vascularization (quantified as the percentage of vessel-like structures) and collagen deposition. Data will be analyzed using ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests to determine significant differences between groups.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that the Group 2 (24-hour inflammation) will exhibit a significantly higher percentage of vascularized callus tissue compared to both Group 1 (Control) and Group 3 (48-hour inflammation). We expect Group 3’s callus will display increased collagen deposition reflecting a prolonged inflammatory response. This suggests that an initial, relatively short, period of inflammation is crucial for initiating vascular regeneration in the wound callus. This supports a model where brief inflammation triggers vascular development.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of exogenous application of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) on callus tissue formation in a standardized wound model in *Drosophila melanogaster*?

**Methodology:** This experiment will utilize *Drosophila melanogaster* larvae.  Larvae will be subjected to a standardized wound (small excision) and randomly assigned to two groups (n=40 per group): a control group receiving no treatment and a treatment group injected with a concentrated solution of recombinant PDGF. The PDGF solution will be delivered via direct injection into the wound site.  At 60 hours post-injury, larvae will be dissected, and callus tissue samples collected.  Histological examination (toluidine blue staining) will be conducted to assess callus tissue volume and the degree of vascularization.  Measurements of callus volume and vascular density (using image analysis software) will be recorded.  Statistical analysis (t-test) will compare callus volume and vascular density between the two groups.

**Expected Outcomes:** We predict that the larvae treated with PDGF will demonstrate a significantly larger callus volume and a greater degree of vascularization compared to the untreated control group.  This would indicate that PDGF enhances the tissue regeneration process by stimulating both cell proliferation and vascular development, potentially demonstrating a mechanism for tissue repair.

## Research Question 3: How can we accurately measure the expression levels of collagen type I mRNA within a developing wound callus?

**Methodology:** This investigation will employ *Caenorhabditis elegans* as a model organism. Worms will be subjected to a standardized wound (small incision) and divided into three groups (n=50 per group): a control group, a group treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotic to suppress bacterial influence, and a group treated with a specific RNA interference (RNAi) targeting collagen type I mRNA.  At 48 hours post-injury, worms will be euthanized, and their heads dissected.  RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) will be performed on the extracted RNA to measure the relative levels of collagen type I mRNA.  Data will be normalized to a housekeeping gene (β-actin) and analyzed using ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that the worms treated with RNAi targeting collagen type I mRNA will exhibit a significantly reduced expression level of collagen type I mRNA within their wound tissue compared to the control and antibiotic-treated groups.  This would allow for a quantitative assessment of collagen expression during callus formation and provide insights into the regulatory mechanisms governing collagen deposition, offering valuable insights for potential therapeutic interventions.
