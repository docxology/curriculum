## Bark Grafting – Study Notes

**Introduction:** Bark grafting is a straightforward and reliable method for propagating woody plants, particularly well-suited for larger scions and established trees. It leverages the natural healing capabilities of bark to create a strong union. This session will cover the key steps involved, highlighting best practices and troubleshooting common issues.

**Key Concepts:**

**Bark Collar**: **Bark Collar**: A specialized collar constructed around the base of the scion, typically made of cardboard, rubber, or burlap, used to retain the scion bark in close contact with the rootstock bark, promoting efficient cambial contact and successful grafting.

**Cambial Contact**: **Cambial Contact**: The critical point of union between the vascular cambium of the rootstock and the scion, essential for the formation of vascular connections and the subsequent transfer of water, nutrients, and sugars – the very foundation of successful grafting.

**Scion Preparation**: **Scion Preparation**: The process of selecting and preparing the scion wood, which involves carefully trimming the shoot to create a clean, exposed surface for attachment to the rootstock. This typically involves removing leaves and buds to ensure maximum contact.

**Rootstock Selection**: **Rootstock Selection**: The choice of the rootstock is paramount; it must be compatible with the scion and provide desirable traits like disease resistance, vigor, and adaptation to the growing environment.

**Bark**: **Bark**: The outermost layer of tissue covering the stem or branch of a woody plant; it provides protection against environmental stresses and plays a crucial role in facilitating cambial contact during grafting.

**Binding Techniques**: **Binding Techniques**: The methods employed to securely hold the scion bark and rootstock bark together during the healing process. Common techniques include rubber bands, grafting tape, and binding materials like burlap or hessian.

**Healing Process**: **Healing Process**: The natural biological response of the plant tissues to the grafted union, involving cell division, tissue regeneration, and the formation of vascular connections. This process is facilitated by maintaining close contact between the scion and rootstock.

**Vascular Union**: **Vascular Union**: The formation of connected vascular tissues (cambium) between the scion and rootstock, enabling the transfer of water, nutrients, and sugars – the physiological hallmark of a successful graft.

**Bark Grafting Procedure – Step by Step:**

1.  **Rootstock Preparation:** Select a healthy rootstock. Ensure the bark is clean and free of any disease or damage.
2.  **Scion Preparation:** Select a scion of the desired variety. Cut a scion shoot with a clean, sloping cut.
3.  **Bark Collar Construction:** Create a bark collar around the base of the rootstock. The collar should be large enough to accommodate the scion bark and allow for some movement.
4.  **Scion Placement:** Carefully slide the scion bark beneath the bark collar, ensuring close contact with the rootstock bark.
5.  **Binding:** Secure the scion and rootstock together using appropriate binding material, maintaining consistent pressure.
6.  **Monitoring:** Regularly check the graft union for signs of healing.

**Troubleshooting:**

*   **Poor Contact:** If contact is lacking, consider repositioning the scion or using a larger bark collar.
*   **Excessive Healing:** Too much binding can inhibit cambial contact. Adjust binding pressure.
*   **Rotting:** Ensure proper ventilation and address any underlying fungal issues.
