Okay, here’s the requested output following all specifications and requirements.

## Research Question 1: How does the age of the rootstock affect vascular union during a bark graft in *Prunus persica* (peach)?

**Methodology:** This investigation will examine the relationship between rootstock age and vascular union success in peach grafts. We will propagate peach trees from rootstocks of three distinct ages: 1-year-old, 3-year-old, and 5-year-old.  For each age group, we will graft a uniform scion of a known variety (e.g., ‘Elberta’) onto a minimum of 20 rootstocks.  Following grafting, the grafted trees will be subjected to a controlled environment and monitored for signs of vascular union – primarily through histological analysis of the graft junction at 30, 60, and 90 days post-grafting.  We'll employ a microtome to prepare thin cross-sections of the graft tissue, stained with phloroglucinol to visualize xylem and phloem. Data will be recorded on graft success rates (determined by the presence of xylem/phloem continuity) and histological observations regarding the degree of vascular connection.  Statistical analysis (ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests) will be used to compare vascular union rates across the age groups.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that younger rootstocks (1-year-old) will demonstrate a higher rate of successful vascular union compared to older rootstocks (3-year-old and 5-year-old). This is hypothesized because younger rootstocks possess greater cambial activity and a more receptive tissue environment for new vascular connections.  Histological analysis is expected to reveal more pronounced xylem/phloem continuity in the younger rootstocks.  Conversely, we predict that the cambial activity of older rootstocks will diminish, potentially resulting in weaker vascular connections and lower graft success rates. The findings will provide valuable insight into optimizing grafting techniques for peach propagation, specifically regarding rootstock selection to maximize vascular union rates.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of varying the angle of the scion cut on vascular union in *Malus domestica* (apple)?

**Methodology:** This investigation will assess the impact of scion cut angle on vascular union within apple grafts. We will propagate apple trees from rootstocks of a standardized age (3-year-old) and graft a uniform scion of a known variety (‘Gala’) onto a minimum of 30 rootstocks. Crucially, we will employ three distinct scion cut angles: 45 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees, all relative to the rootstock. Following grafting, the grafted trees will be closely monitored for signs of vascular union for a period of 60 days.  Assessment will be conducted through a combination of visual inspection (looking for signs of callus formation and vascular staining), and non-destructive measurements (using calipers to assess the width of the graft junction).  Digital photographs will be taken weekly to document the progression of callus formation.  At the conclusion of the 60-day observation period, a subset of the graft junctions will be subjected to microtome sectioning and staining (as in Question 1) to confirm vascular union and assess tissue morphology.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that a scion cut angle of 45 degrees will result in the highest rate of vascular union. This angle is expected to create the most favorable contact area between the scion and rootstock tissues, allowing for optimal mechanical fit and tissue overlap. A 90-degree cut is predicted to yield the lowest success rate due to the greater risk of tissue disruption and limited contact area.  The visual observations and histological data should demonstrate a clear correlation between scion cut angle and the degree of vascular union. This study will provide practical guidance for optimizing grafting techniques for apple propagation, considering the precise angle required for maximal vascular connection.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the degree of vascular continuity at the graft junction using image analysis?

**Methodology:** This investigation will utilize image analysis techniques to quantify the degree of vascular continuity at the graft junction.  We will collect a large dataset of digital images (high resolution photographs and microtome cross-sections) of graft junctions from *Prunus persica* and *Malus domestica* trees, as used in previous investigations. These images will be digitized and imported into image analysis software (e.g., ImageJ/Fiji). We will manually trace the boundaries of the xylem and phloem tissues within each image, creating binary masks.  Quantitative measurements, such as the percentage of tissue area occupied by xylem and phloem, the length of continuous vascular channels, and the presence of any gaps or disruptions, will be calculated.  We will develop a standardized protocol for image processing and measurement to ensure repeatability and minimize subjectivity. We will also explore automated segmentation techniques using machine learning algorithms to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the analysis.

**Expected Outcomes:** The image analysis will provide a standardized and objective method for assessing vascular union. We expect to establish a correlation between the quantitative measurements (e.g., percentage of vascular tissue, length of continuous channels) and the observed success of the grafts. The study will identify key features of the graft junction that are most strongly associated with vascular continuity. Furthermore, the development and validation of automated segmentation techniques will provide a robust and efficient method for assessing vascular union in future grafting studies. This research will lay the foundation for a systematic approach to evaluating graft performance based on quantifiable tissue characteristics.
