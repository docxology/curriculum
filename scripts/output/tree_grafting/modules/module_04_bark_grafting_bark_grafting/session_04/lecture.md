## Bark Grafting – Procedure & Troubleshooting

### Introduction

Welcome back to the Bark Grafting module. In our previous sessions, we’ve explored the foundational principles of grafting – understanding cambium contact, the necessity of vascular union, and the selection of compatible scion and rootstock varieties. We’ve discussed the general techniques of wedge and cleft grafting. Today’s session focuses specifically on bark grafting, a method particularly well-suited for larger scions, often employed when working with established trees or shrubs where precise scion size control is less critical. Bark grafting relies on the natural ability of bark to heal, creating a strong union. This technique is simpler than some others, making it accessible to students at various levels of grafting experience. We’ll delve into the procedural steps, explore different binding techniques, and importantly, address common troubleshooting issues that can arise.

## Bark Preparation

Proper bark preparation is absolutely crucial for successful bark grafting. The goal is to create a clean, exposed surface on the rootstock that the scion bark can readily attach to. The scion bark should be carefully trimmed, typically from the upper part of the shoot, ensuring it’s free of any leaves or buds. The size of the bark strip needs to be considered; generally, it should be approximately 2-4 cm wide and 5-10 cm long, depending on the size of the rootstock.  **Bark**: The outermost layer of tissue covering the stem or branch of a woody plant.  Too little bark exposed, and the scion won't have a surface to adhere to. Too much, and you risk excessive healing, impeding cambial contact. The rootstock bark must be clean; remove any loose or decaying material.  For example, if you're grafting a peach tree, ensure the rootstock bark is free of any fungal growth or blight. The process is best undertaken when the rootstock bark is relatively soft, often after a light rain.  Consider the bark’s texture; it should be pliable, not brittle.

## Binding Techniques

Once the bark is prepared, securing it to the rootstock is paramount. Several binding techniques are commonly employed. The first and arguably most common is the use of grafting tape. **Grafting Tape**: A specialized, fibrous tape designed to hold graft union together.  This tape is applied over the scion and rootstock bark, overlapping slightly to ensure a tight bond. Another method involves utilizing rubber bands. For instance, a wide rubber band can be wrapped around the graft union, providing a compressive force.  However, be cautious with rubber bands, as they can sometimes impede cambial contact if applied too tightly.  A third technique involves using raffia, a natural fiber cord.  Consider how tightly the binding should be – sufficient to hold the graft in place, but not so tight as to restrict growth or impede cambial contact. Wrapping in a spiral pattern is often recommended.

## The Grafting Process – Step-by-Step

Let's now outline the practical steps of a bark graft. 1.  Prepare the rootstock as described above. 2.  Cut the scion bark into a strip, approximately 2-4cm wide. 3.  Apply the grafting tape around the scion bark. 4.  Position the scion bark against the rootstock bark, ensuring good contact.  5.  Secure the scion bark to the rootstock using the grafting tape, overlapping the edges. 6.  For instance, when grafting a quince tree onto a crabapple rootstock, maintain firm contact. 7.  Finally, apply a grafting wax or sealant over the union to further protect it from desiccation and infection.  This sealant is crucial for maintaining moisture and preventing pathogens from entering the graft.

## Common Troubleshooting Issues

Despite careful preparation and execution, bark grafts can sometimes fail. One frequent issue is insufficient cambial contact. This can occur if the scion bark is too tightly bound, restricting growth. Another problem is excessive healing. This might happen if the rootstock bark is excessively cleaned, leading to rapid, callous-like healing that overwhelms the cambium. Consider this: If the rootstock has been extensively treated with wound sealant, this can interfere with the formation of a proper graft union.  Furthermore, contamination from fungal spores is a significant concern. Such contamination can lead to graft failure. For example, if the weather is humid and wet, the risk of fungal infection is heightened. Finally, poor scion size selection can also contribute to failure.  Imagine trying to graft a small, delicate scion onto a large, vigorous rootstock – the scion might simply be overwhelmed.

## Long-Term Care & Monitoring

After performing the graft, consistent monitoring is essential. Regularly inspect the graft union for signs of growth – small bumps or swelling indicate successful cambial contact.  For instance, look for the emergence of fine shoots from the scion.  Remove any excess rootstock growth that appears below the graft union.  Continue to protect the graft from harsh weather conditions.  Consider providing shade during periods of intense sunlight. Regular trimming can also be beneficial, encouraging the scion to grow and strengthen.

## Summary & Key Takeaways

Today’s session focused on the bark grafting technique, a simple and effective method for joining scions and rootstocks. We covered the critical aspects of bark preparation, binding techniques, and common troubleshooting issues. Remember, successful bark grafting relies heavily on proper technique, meticulous attention to detail, and consistent monitoring. Key concepts covered included: **Graft Collar**: The swollen area at the base of a woody plant stem, which contains dormant buds and plays a crucial role in wound healing and graft union formation. The overall goal is to establish efficient cambial contact, allowing for vascular union and ultimately, the successful integration of the scion and rootstock. Remember to consistently apply these principles for best results.
