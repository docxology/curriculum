**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Which of the following best describes the term "cambium" in the context of grafting?
A) The outermost layer of the rootstock bark.
B) The vascular tissue responsible for growth.
C) The protective outer layer of the scion.
D) The tissue that produces fruit.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The cambium is a thin layer of meristematic cells that lies just beneath the bark in woody plants.  It’s crucial for generating new xylem and phloem, enabling growth and vascular union during grafting.

**Question 3:** Why is it important to minimize leaf and bud tissue when preparing scion bark for a bark graft?
A) To reduce the weight of the scion.
B) To prevent excessive healing, which can impede cambial contact.
C) To make the scion easier to handle.
D) To increase the absorption of nutrients.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Excess scion tissue creates too much healing, potentially overwhelming the cambial layer and preventing the necessary vascular connection required for a successful graft union.

**Question 4:** What is the main purpose of binding the scion and rootstock together during a bark graft?
A) To provide aesthetic appeal.
B) To create a stable connection that facilitates vascular union.
C) To prevent the scion from drying out.
D) To introduce nutrients to the graft site.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Precise binding is vital to hold the scion and rootstock together while allowing the cambial layers to contact each other, creating the necessary vascular connection for successful graft union.

**Question 5:** If the rootstock bark is excessively decayed, what potential problem would this cause during a bark graft?
A) Increased scion growth.
B) Reduced likelihood of successful vascular union.
C) Enhanced nutrient uptake by the scion.
D) Improved bark healing rates.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Decayed rootstock bark lacks the necessary tissue for a solid vascular connection, significantly reducing the chance of successful graft union and proper nutrient exchange.

**Question 6:** Describe the ideal condition for successful bark grafting, relating it to the rootstock and scion?
**Answer:**  Successful bark grafting requires close contact between the outer bark layers of the rootstock and scion, particularly the cambium. This close contact must be stabilized by a binding agent to create a solid vascular connection, allowing for nutrient exchange and the formation of a new, integrated plant. Without this vital connection, the graft will fail.

**Question 7:**  Explain why it’s often recommended to use peach tree wax for binding bark grafts.?
**Answer:** Peach tree wax is ideal because it’s biocompatible with peach tissue, meaning it won’t cause harm or rejection.  Additionally, it provides a flexible, secure binding, promoting vascular union while minimizing the risk of disrupting the delicate cambial layer of both the rootstock and the scion.

**Question 8:**  Suppose you observe the scion bark is significantly larger than the rootstock bark. How might this impact your grafting technique?
**Answer:**  A large scion bark compared to the rootstock requires a more delicate approach, focusing on minimizing the amount of scion tissue exposeD) This could necessitate the use of a smaller bark strip and meticulous binding to prevent excessive healing, which would impede cambial contact.

**Question 9:**  Imagine you’re grafting a peach tree and notice the rootstock bark is covered in a fungal growth. What actions should you take before attempting a bark graft?
**Answer:** Before grafting, you must address the fungal growth by carefully cleaning the rootstock bark using a suitable fungicide or antiseptic solution. Removing the fungal contamination ensures a clean, healthy surface for the scion bark to adhere to, preventing infection and promoting successful vascular union.

**Question 10:**  Describe how the success of a bark graft is ultimately determined?
**Answer:** The success of a bark graft is determined by the establishment of a vascular connection between the cambial layers of the scion and rootstock. This connection, facilitated by close contact and appropriate binding, allows for nutrient and water transport, ultimately leading to the growth of a new, integrated plant.
