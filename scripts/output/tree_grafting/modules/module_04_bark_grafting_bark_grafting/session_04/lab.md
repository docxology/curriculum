**Module: Bark Grafting – Lab 4: Binding Techniques**

**Lab Number:** 4
**Lab Focus:** Binding Techniques

**1. Brief Background (87 words)**

Following the lecture on bark grafting, this lab focuses on the crucial step of securing the scion bark to the rootstock. Successful bark grafting relies heavily on precise binding to facilitate vascular union. Students will practice various binding techniques—wax, twine, or rubber bands—to firmly hold the scion and rootstock together. The goal is to create a stable connection, allowing the graft union to heal correctly. Improper binding can compromise cambial contact and ultimately, the success of the graft. This lab builds upon prior knowledge and emphasizes the practical application of grafting principles.

**2. Lab Objectives**

*   Prepare rootstock and scion bark according to established standards.
*   Execute three different binding techniques – wax, twine, and rubber bands – on bark graft unions.
*   Assess the effectiveness of each binding method in holding the scion and rootstock together.
*   Document observations regarding the appearance and stability of the graft unions.
*   Analyze the impact of different binding materials on graft union development.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   **Rootstock Material:** 20 peach (Prunus persica) seedlings, approximately 1-2 inches in diameter.
*   **Scion Material:** 20 peach scion pieces, 2-4 cm wide, 5-10 cm long, cut from established peach trees (ensure variety compatibility).
*   **Binding Materials:**
    *   Peach Tree Wax (500g container) – [INSTRUCTOR: Ensure wax is appropriate for peach tissue]
    *   Natural Twine (100m roll) – 2mm width.
    *   Rubber Bands (various sizes - 10 each)
*   **Cutting Tools:** Sharp grafting knives (2 per student), pruning shears.
*   **Mixing Containers:** Small beakers or jars (2 per student)
*   **Work Surfaces:** Clean, sanitized wooden boards (2 per group).
*   **Sanitizing Solution:** 70% isopropyl alcohol.

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

*   ⚠️ **Sharp Object Hazard:** Grafting knives are extremely sharp. Use caution and maintain a firm grip. [INSTRUCTOR: Demonstrate proper knife handling techniques].
*   ⚠️ **Skin Irritation:** 70% isopropyl alcohol is a skin irritant. Avoid contact with skin and eyes.
*   ⚠️ **Allergen Potential:**  Peach tree wax could trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.  Use in a well-ventilated area.
*   ⚠️ **Splinters:** Use care when handling wood to avoid splinters.
*   ⚠️ **PPE:** Wear safety glasses at all times.  Gloves (latex or nitrile) recommended.

**5. Procedure**

1.  **Rootstock Preparation:** Using pruning shears, prepare 20 peach rootstock seedlings, cutting them to a uniform length of 10cm. Clean the bark of each rootstock seedling with a sanitized cloth and 70% isopropyl alcohol.
2.  **Scion Preparation:** Select 20 peach scion pieces, ensuring approximately 2-4cm width and 5-10cm length.
3.  **Grafting:**  For each rootstock seedling, make a 10cm long wedge cut. Then, apply a small amount of peach tree wax to the cut surface of the rootstock.  Position the scion piece onto the prepared rootstock, ensuring the bark makes intimate contact.
4.  **Binding - Wax:**  Apply a generous amount of peach tree wax over the scion and rootstock union.
5.  **Binding - Twine:** Wrap twine tightly around the graft union, securing it snugly.
6.  **Binding – Rubber Bands:** Secure the graft union with rubber bands, ensuring even pressure.
7.  **Repeat:** Repeat steps 3-6 for all 20 graft unions.
8.  **Labeling:** Clearly label each graft union with student name and date.

**6. Data Collection**

| Graft Union ID | Binding Method | Visual Observations (Appearance) | Stability (1-5, 5=Very Stable) | Notes/Potential Issues |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Wax |  |  |  |
| 2 | Twine |  |  |  |
| 3 | Rubber Bands |  |  |  |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**7. Analysis Questions**

1.  How does the choice of binding material impact the stability of the graft union?
2.  What is the role of wax in facilitating graft union formation?
3.  Explain why careful bark preparation is essential for successful bark grafting.
4.  Describe a scenario where a binding method might fail and suggest a corrective action.
5.   How does maintaining cambial contact contribute to the success of the graft union?

**8. Expected Results**

Students should observe that each binding method creates a stable graft union. Wax provides a strong, pliable bond, twine offers secure support, and rubber bands offer a simple but effective fastening.  Graft unions secured with wax will exhibit a strong, pliable connection.  Graft unions secured with twine will appear more rigid.  The success of each binding method will be visually assessed, and stability will be rated on a scale of 1 to 5.  Students should recognize that the specific method chosen can influence the appearance and long-term success of the graft.
