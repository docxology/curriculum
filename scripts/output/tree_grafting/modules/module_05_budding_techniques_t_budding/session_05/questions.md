**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Which of the following best describes the role of the cambium layer in plant tissue?
A) It transports water and minerals throughout the plant.
B) It’s responsible for producing secondary xylem and phloem.
C) It’s the outermost protective layer of the root.
D) It’s involved in photosynthesis within the leaf.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The cambium is a layer of actively dividing cells that produces new xylem and phloem, crucial for plant growth and wood formation.  This layer’s function directly supports the T-budding process by facilitating new shoot development.

**Question 3:** What is ‘de-ribbing’ in the context of scion preparation for T-budding?
A) Applying a fungicide to protect the bud.
B) Removing the outer bark to expose the bud scales.
C) Adding nutrients directly to the bud.
D) Shaping the scion into a T-shape.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** ‘De-ribbing’ involves carefully removing the outer bark to reveal the bud scales, creating the optimal conditions for callus formation and successful bud integration during T-budding.

**Question 4:** Why is hydration of the scion critical during T-budding preparation?
A) To increase the scion’s resistance to fungal infections.
B) To stimulate faster growth of the new shoot.
C) To enhance the scion’s ability to absorb nutrients from the rootstock.
D) To create a more aesthetically pleasing scion shape.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Adequate hydration ensures the scion’s cells are plump and receptive, facilitating optimal callus formation and successful integration with the rootstock’s cambium layer during the T-budding process.

**Question 5:** What is a primary reason for selecting a young, actively growing shoot for scion preparation?
A) Older shoots have a higher concentration of sugars.
B) Younger shoots contain more mature, established bud scales.
C) Younger shoots are more vigorous and adaptable.
D) Older shoots are easier to shape and manipulate.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Young, actively growing shoots provide the best conditions for bud development and subsequent callus formation, maximizing the chances of successful T-budding and new shoot establishment.

**Question 6:**  Describe the significance of the cambium layer in relation to the success of T-budding?
**Answer:** The cambium layer is vital because it's a layer of actively dividing cells.  When a scion is inserted, this cambium layer initiates callus formation, which is essentially the plant's process of repairing and regenerating tissue.  This connection is essential for the new shoot to integrate with the rootstock and grow successfully – a failure here drastically reduces the chances of a successful graft.

**Question 7:**  Considering the lab procedure, how does maintaining a sterile work environment contribute to successful scion preparation?
**Answer:** Maintaining a sterile environment minimizes the risk of contamination by bacteria or fungi. These microorganisms could harm the scion and rootstock, preventing callus formation and ultimately, the successful grafting process. The sterile environment ensures healthy tissue and optimal conditions for graft integration.

**Question 8:**  If a scion is taken from a dry environment, what adjustment would be most important to make *before* attempting T-budding?
**Answer:** It’s crucial to rehydrate the scion.  Dehydrated cells are unable to properly form the callus needed for integration with the rootstock.  Rehydrating ensures the cells are plump and receptive, dramatically increasing the chances of a successful graft.

**Question 9:**  Explain how the density of the bark on the rootstock might influence the success of T-budding.?
**Answer:** Excessively thick bark hinders the cambium layer's ability to contact and integrate with the scion’s cambium. This limited contact reduces callus formation, potentially leading to graft failure, highlighting the importance of selecting rootstocks with appropriate bark density.

**Question 10:**  In what ways could careful observation of scion quality – specifically regarding bud size and appearance – impact the T-budding process?
**Answer:**  Healthy, plump buds are essential for successful callus formation.  Smaller or damaged buds may not have sufficient cell mass to initiate proper integration, potentially hindering the growth of the new shoot. Monitoring bud quality is therefore paramount for optimizing grafting success.
