## Open Question 1: What is the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas13 mediated RNA degradation in plant disease resistance?

Context: Plant-pathogen interactions are increasingly understood through epigenetic modifications. Recent research focuses on the role of RNA degradation systems, particularly CRISPR-Cas13, in triggering innate immune responses. Understanding precisely *how* Cas13 targets and degrades specific pathogen RNA is critical for engineering more robust and targeted disease resistance strategies. Current research explores the kinetics and specificity of this RNA targeting process.

## Open Question 2: How does the microbiome composition influence the efficacy of induced systemic resistance (ISR) in tomato plants?

Context: Induced systemic resistance (ISR) is a natural defense mechanism triggered by beneficial microbes, yet the precise interactions that govern its strength are complex. Research suggests that the diversity and abundance of microbial communities strongly affect the plant’s ability to mount a robust defense. Determining the key microbial taxa and their specific signaling pathways are vital for developing sustainable agricultural practices. Current research is exploring the role of quorum sensing.

## Open Question 3: What are the implications of exome-wide association studies (GWAS) for identifying novel genes involved in drought tolerance in crops?

Context: Climate change demands developing crops with improved drought tolerance. Traditional breeding often relies on identifying single genes. However, drought tolerance is likely determined by complex, polygenic interactions. Exome-wide association studies (GWAS) offer a powerful approach to identifying these novel genes. Understanding the genetic architecture of drought tolerance will revolutionize crop breeding and adaptation strategies. Current research is investigating the role of gene regulatory networks.
