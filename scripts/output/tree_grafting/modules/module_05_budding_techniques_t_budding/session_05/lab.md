**Module: Budding Techniques (T-Budding)**
**Lab Number: 5**
**Lab Focus: Scion Preparation**

**1. Brief Background (98 words)**

Following our lecture on T-budding, this laboratory exercise concentrates on the critical initial step: scion preparation. The success of this technique hinges on creating optimal conditions for callus formation between the scion and rootstock. The process of ‘de-ribbing’ the scion – carefully removing the outer bark – is essential for exposing the cambium layer, which is responsible for initiating new growth. Understanding the influence of bark density and scion hydration is vital for maximizing success. This exercise will provide hands-on experience in preparing scions for the subsequent T-budding insertion. [INSTRUCTOR: Briefly demonstrate proper scion selection and ‘de-ribbing’ technique].

**2. Lab Objectives**

*   Select a suitable scion for T-budding.
*   Precisely ‘de-rib’ a scion, exposing the bud scales.
*   Assess scion hydration and adjust as necessary.
*   Maintain a sterile work environment throughout the procedure.
*   Document observations regarding scion quality and hydration.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   **Rootstock:** 20 Rosa ‘Peace’ rose rootstocks (approximately 12 inches tall) – pre-treated according to [INSTRUCTOR: Provided protocol]
*   **Scions:** 15 Rosa ‘Peace’ scions (1-2 inches long, with 3-5 plump buds)
*   **Sharp Knives:** 15 x Sterile, #5 or #7 single-bevel grafting knives
*   **Sterile Pads:** 15 x Gauze pads
*   **70% Ethanol:** 100 ml bottle
*   **Water:** Distilled or deionized water
*   **Spray Bottles:** 3 x Small spray bottles (100 ml capacity)
*   **Gloves:** Sterile nitrile gloves (15 pairs)
*   **Work Surfaces:** Clean, sanitized lab benches (3)
*   **Scale:** Digital scale (0.01g resolution)

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

*   **Sharp Objects:** The grafting knives are extremely sharp. Handle with care. [INSTRUCTOR: Demonstrate safe knife handling techniques].
*   **Chemical Exposure:** 70% ethanol is flammable and an irritant. Avoid inhalation and skin contact. Use in a well-ventilated area.
*   **Skin Contact:** Prolonged skin contact with 70% ethanol can cause irritation. Wear gloves at all times.
*   **Eye Protection:** Goggles or safety glasses *must* be worn to protect against splashes.
*   **Biological Hazard:** While the rootstock is a common rose, potential for contamination exists. Maintain strict sterile technique.

**5. Procedure**

1.  **Preparation:** Each student receives a rootstock and a scion. Don sterile nitrile gloves.
2.  **Scion Inspection:** Examine your scion for bud health and stem density.  Record any observations in the data table.
3.  **Hydration Assessment:** Assess the scion’s hydration. If the scion appears dry, lightly mist with distilled water from a spray bottle. (Approximately 5 seconds)
4.  **De-ribbing:** Using a sterile grafting knife, carefully cut the base of the scion at a 45-degree angle. Using a steady hand, gently slide the knife along the stem to remove the outer bark, exposing the bud scales. Maintain a 45-degree angle. *Do not cut into the bud scales*.
5.  **Repeat:** Repeat the de-ribbing process, if necessary, until the bud scales are exposed.
6.  **Observation:** Carefully observe the exposed bud scales and the cambium layer.
7.  **Clean Up:** Dispose of used gauze pads in designated biohazard containers.

**6. Data Collection**

| Observation                               | Student 1 | Student 2 | Student 3 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Scion Bud Count                          |             |             |             |
| Bark Density (e.g., thick, medium, thin)  |             |             |             |
| Degree of De-ribbing (1-5, 1=fully exposed) |             |             |             |
| Scion Hydration (Dry, Moist, Saturated) |             |             |             |
| Any other relevant notes                 |             |             |             |

**7. Analysis Questions**

1.  Why is it crucial to expose the cambium layer when preparing a T-budding scion?
2.  How does bark density affect the success of callus formation?
3.  What immediate action should you take if your scion appears to be drying out?
4.  Explain the relationship between scion hydration and successful T-budding.
5.  How does precise knife technique impact the quality of the scion preparation?

**8. Expected Results**

Students should observe healthy bud scales exposed by the de-ribbing process.  Successful scion preparation will result in clear exposure of the cambium layer.  Students should record observations regarding hydration levels, bark density, and the degree of de-ribbing. Variations in bark density will lead to different degrees of exposure. Consistent and precise knife technique will result in a cleaner de-ribbed scion.
