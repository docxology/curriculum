**Module: Cleft Grafting & Crust Grafting – Lab 3: Preparing the Cleft**

**Lab Number:** 3
**Lab Focus:** Preparing the Cleft

**Related Topics:** Binding Methods

**Learning Objectives:**
*   Precisely create a cleft in a rootstock using a [INSTRUCTOR]-specified blade.
*   Remove bark and loose tissue from the cleft’s cut surface.
*   Maintain a smooth, upward-angled cleft profile.
*   Assess the cleanliness and depth of the prepared cleft.
*   Document observations regarding cleft preparation.

**1. Background (98 words)**

This laboratory exercise builds upon the foundational principles of cleft grafting, as discussed in lecture. Successful cleft grafting relies on the establishment of a vascular cambium interface, fostering nutrient and water exchange between the scion and rootstock. The precise preparation of the cleft – specifically, its size, shape, and cleanliness – significantly impacts the formation of this crucial interface and, therefore, graft acceptance.  A correctly prepared cleft maximizes contact with the cambium, promoting robust callus development. The subsequent steps will focus on utilizing this properly prepared cleft as the foundation for graft union.

**2. Materials and Equipment**

*   **Rootstocks:** 30 Salal (Gaultheria procumbens) cuttings, approximately 1.5 cm diameter at the base.
*   **Scions:** 30 Nana Blueberry scions, approximately 7 cm long, 0.5 cm diameter.
*   [INSTRUCTOR]-Provided Grafting Blades (Sharp, Sterile – 10mm blade recommended) - 30
*   Sterile Gauze Pads - 30
*   70% Ethanol – 1 Liter
*   Disposable Gloves – 30 pairs
*   Sterile Forceps – 30
*   Ruler – 1
*   Cutting Board – 1
*   Waste Container – 1 (Designated for sharps)

**3. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

⚠️ **Sharp Objects:** Handle grafting blades with extreme caution.  Always cut away from yourself and others. Dispose of used blades immediately in the designated sharps container.
⚠️ **Chemical Hazards:** 70% Ethanol is flammable.  Work in a well-ventilated area. Avoid open flames.
⚠️ **Biological Hazards:** While Salal cuttings are generally free of significant pathogens, use disposable gloves to minimize risk of contamination. Wash hands thoroughly after handling.
⚠️ **Physical Hazards:** Maintain a stable work surface to prevent slips and falls.

**PPE Requirements:** Disposable gloves, safety glasses (ANSI Z87.1 rated), lab coat.

**4. Procedure (Numbered Steps)**

1.  **Preparation:** Each student receives one Salal rootstock and one Nana Blueberry scion. Place the rootstock on the cutting board.
2.  **Blade Sterilization:** Sterilize the grafting blade with 70% ethanol. Wipe thoroughly.
3.  **Cleft Creation:** Using the sterilized blade, make a clean, angled cut approximately 7 cm long into the rootstock. Angle the cut slightly upwards, creating a recessed cleft. Aim for an angle of approximately 45 degrees.
4.  **Bark Removal:** Gently remove any loose bark or tissue from the cut surface of the cleft. Use sterile forceps if necessary to avoid contamination. [INSTRUCTOR] will demonstrate techniques for removing bark without damaging the cambium.
5.  **Cleft Inspection:** Assess the cleanliness and depth of the cleft. Ensure the cambium is exposed.
6.  **Repeat:** Repeat steps 3-6 for the remaining rootstocks and scions.

**5. Data Collection**

| Observation                        | Score (1-5, 5=Excellent) | Notes                               |
| :--------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| Cleft Size (cm)                   |                          | [INSTRUCTOR] – Guide students to assess |
| Cleft Angle (degrees)              |                          |                                     |
| Bark Removal (Cleanliness)          |                          |  Presence of residual bark            |
| Cambium Exposure                |                          |  Visibility of cambium layer         |
| Overall Cleft Quality              |                          |  Overall appearance and readiness   |

**6. Analysis Questions**

1.  How does the size and angle of the cleft affect the potential for cambium contact?
2.  Why is it important to remove bark and loose tissue from the cleft surface?
3.  What would happen if the cambium layer was not exposed during cleft preparation?
4.  Describe the importance of a clean, smooth cleft in maximizing graft acceptance.
5.  How might the technique used influence the final outcomes of the graft union?

**7. Expected Results**

Students should observe cleanly cut rootstocks with clefts approximately 7 cm long, angled at approximately 45 degrees. The cut surfaces should expose the cambium layer, and any loose bark or tissue should be removed. The rootstocks should appear ready for scion insertion.
