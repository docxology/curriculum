## Research Question 1: How does the size of the rootstock cleft impact the success rate of crust grafting?

Methodology: This investigation will involve creating a series of graft experiments utilizing a common rootstock species (e.g., *Malus domestica*).  We will prepare rootstocks with varying cleft widths, ranging from 3mm to 9mm.  Each rootstock will be treated identically regarding debridement and the application of grafting wax.  For each size category (3mm, 6mm, 9mm), we will graft multiple shoots (n=10) onto healthy rootstock recipients.  Following grafting, the grafts will be monitored daily for signs of vascular integration, evidenced by the formation of a callous tissue at the graft junction.  Measurements of the callus tissue diameter will be taken every three days for a period of six weeks.  The success rate of each graft will be determined based on the complete integration of the graft tissue with the rootstock tissue, indicated by the absence of a distinct graft union.  Statistical analysis (ANOVA and post-hoc tests) will be used to determine significant differences in the success rates among the different cleft sizes.

Expected Outcomes: We anticipate that a moderately sized cleft (6mm) will yield the highest success rate of crust grafting. This is because a moderately large surface area provides sufficient contact for the callus tissue to develop effectively, facilitating vascular connection.  We predict that smaller clefts (3mm and 6mm) will show similar success rates, while excessively large clefts (9mm) may result in poor callus formation due to excessive tissue exposure and potential for fungal contamination, leading to lower graft success rates.  The data collected will quantitatively demonstrate a positive correlation between cleft size and graft success, providing a practical guideline for optimizing crust grafting techniques.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of varying the grafting wax composition on the rate of callus formation?

Methodology: This investigation will assess the influence of different grafting wax formulations on the formation of the callus tissue at the graft interface. We will utilize a standardized rootstock species (*Prunus avium*) and prepare graft wounds with a consistent diameter (5mm). Four distinct grafting wax compositions will be tested: (1) standard commercial grafting wax, (2) grafting wax supplemented with a small percentage (0.5%) of honey (considered a natural sealant and potential growth promoter), (3) grafting wax supplemented with a small percentage (0.5%) of calcium chloride (known to stimulate callus formation), and (4) a control group using only standard commercial grafting wax. For each treatment, ten grafts will be performed.  The grafts will be photographed weekly for eight weeks. The percentage of callus coverage at the graft interface will be visually assessed using a standardized scoring system (0-100%) based on photographic evidence. Measurements of callus thickness at the graft junction will be taken using digital calipers every two weeks.  Statistical analysis (ANOVA and post-hoc tests) will be employed to determine significant differences in callus formation rates among the different wax formulations.

Expected Outcomes:  We hypothesize that the inclusion of calcium chloride in the grafting wax will stimulate a faster and more robust callus formation. We anticipate that the calcium chloride-supplemented grafts will exhibit a significantly higher percentage of callus coverage and a greater callus thickness compared to the other treatments. We also predict that the standard commercial grafting wax will show an intermediate level of callus formation, while a control group without any added ingredients would demonstrate the poorest callus formation.  This experiment will provide insight into the potential role of specific additives in promoting vascular integration during crust grafting.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the degree of vascular integration in a crust graft?

Methodology: This investigation will determine the most reliable method for quantifying vascular integration in a crust graft. We will employ a multi-faceted approach, combining visual assessment with non-destructive imaging techniques. Ten *Citrus sinensis* rootstocks will be grafted using standard commercial grafting wax. Following grafting, the grafts will be monitored daily for visual signs of vascular integration, including the formation of a callus tissue. Digital photographs will be taken of each graft at regular intervals (every 3 days) for a period of six weeks.  Additionally, we will utilize a portable confocal microscope to capture cross-sectional images of the graft junction. The confocal images will be analyzed using image analysis software to quantify the thickness and density of the callus tissue at the graft interface.  A scoring system will be developed based on the confocal image analysis results, correlating with the visual assessment of callus development.  The correlation between the scoring system and the confocal image analysis results will be evaluated to determine the most reliable method for assessing vascular integration.

Expected Outcomes: We anticipate that the confocal image analysis, particularly quantitative measurement of callus thickness and density, will provide the most precise and objective measure of vascular integration.  Visual assessment alone is inherently subjective. The quantified data obtained from confocal microscopy will allow for a statistically robust determination of the extent of vascular connection, providing a standardized metric for evaluating graft success and potentially identifying factors affecting vascular integration.  The results will be directly applicable to optimizing grafting protocols for improved graft success rates.
