## Cleft Grafting & Crust Grafting – Study Notes

**Cleft Grafting & Crust Grafting** represents vital techniques in horticultural propagation, particularly when grafting diverse scion sizes and prioritizing economical rapid propagation. Success hinges on manipulating the environment to stimulate a robust callus response, ultimately leading to vascular cambium interface formation – critical for water, nutrient, and sugar transfer between scion and rootstock.

**1. Callus Formation**: **Callus Formation**: The initial, unorganized tissue formed at the graft union, primarily composed of cells actively dividing and differentiating. It’s the foundation for graft acceptance, requiring a sufficient and healthy callus to bridge the gap between scion and rootstock.

**2. Cleft Preparation**: **Cleft Preparation**: The precise creation of a recessed cut in the rootstock, forming the basis of the cleft graft. A typical cleft is 5-10 cm long, angled slightly upwards, providing ample surface area for callus development. The cut's triangular shape maximizes contact for optimal healing.

**3. Graft Acceptance Rates**: **Graft Acceptance Rates**: The percentage of grafts that successfully unite and function properly. These rates vary significantly depending on species, scion and rootstock compatibility, and environmental conditions, generally ranging from 30-80%. Factors like moisture levels and temperature significantly affect success.

**4. Cambium Interface**: **Cambium Interface**: The critical junction formed by the vascular cambium tissue of the scion and rootstock. This interface is responsible for generating new xylem and phloem, allowing for the transfer of water, nutrients, and sugars – the foundation of the graft union.

**5. Glycolysis**: **Glycolysis**: The ten-step metabolic pathway that converts glucose to pyruvate, yielding 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. This process provides the initial energy required for cell division and callus formation within the graft union. *Mnemonic: Glucose -> Pyruvate -> 2 ATP*

**6. Mitochondrial Matrix**: **Mitochondrial Matrix**: The inner compartment of the mitochondrion where the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) occurs, a vital stage in cellular respiration that generates ATP.

**7.  Rootstock Selection**: **Rootstock Selection**: The choice of rootstock has a monumental impact on graft success. Compatible rootstocks provide vigor, disease resistance, and nutrient uptake capabilities. A poorly chosen rootstock can inhibit scion growth and dramatically reduce acceptance rates.

**8.  Environmental Factors**: **Environmental Factors**: External conditions such as temperature, humidity, and light significantly influence graft success. Optimal conditions – generally moderate temperatures and high humidity – promote callus formation and reduce water loss.  Maintaining consistent moisture levels is particularly crucial.

**9.  ATP**: **ATP**: Adenosine triphosphate, the primary energy currency of cells, fueling cellular processes including cell division and callus formation. *Think: "Energy for Growth"*

**10.  Callus Quantity**: **Callus Quantity**:  The amount of healthy callus formed at the graft union. A sufficient, well-developed callus is paramount for a strong, vascular connection. Insufficient callus results in a weak graft prone to failure.
