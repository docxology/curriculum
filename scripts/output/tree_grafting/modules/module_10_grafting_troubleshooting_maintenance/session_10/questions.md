**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Which of the following best describes the process of cambial activity?
A) The formation of new root systems
B) The development of protective bark
C) The division and differentiation of cells in the vascular cambium
D) The hardening of wood tissue
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Cambial activity refers to the continuous cell division within the vascular cambium, which is crucial for producing new xylem and phloem, enabling growth and transport within the plant.

**Question 3:**  What is the most significant environmental factor contributing to desiccation of grafted unions?
A) Increased sunlight exposure
B) Elevated soil pH
C) High temperatures and low humidity
D) Rootstock vigor
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Desiccation is overwhelmingly caused by environmental stressors, particularly high temperatures, low humidity, and wind, which accelerate water loss from the exposed graft tissues.

**Question 4:**  Applying grafting wax to a newly grafted union primarily serves to?
A) Stimulate root development
B) Reduce stem diameter
C) Prevent water loss and protect the wound
D) Increase chlorophyll production
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Grafting wax creates a barrier, preventing water evaporation and protecting the delicate graft union from desiccation, environmental damage, and infection.

**Question 5:**  Why is proper cambial contact essential for successful grafting?
A) To strengthen the rootstock
B) To promote rapid scion growth
C) To establish a vascular connection between the scion and rootstock
D) To increase the plant's resistance to pests
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:**  Successful grafting requires direct physical contact between the cambium layers of the scion and rootstock, facilitating the formation of vascular connections and nutrient exchange.

**Question 6:**  Describe the relationship between scion selection and graft failure?
**Answer:**  Poor scion selection, particularly choosing a scion incompatible with the rootstock, is a primary cause of graft failure.  This incompatibility can disrupt vascular connections and prevent proper callus formation, ultimately leading to the union’s demise.

**Question 7:**  What preventative measure can be implemented to mitigate the effects of desiccation on grafted plants?
**Answer:**  Regularly covering newly grafted unions with a suitable grafting wax is a crucial preventative measure. This wax barrier protects the vulnerable tissues from rapid water loss due to environmental factors like wind and sunlight.

**Question 8:**  How does the size difference between the scion and rootstock typically affect graft success?
**Answer:** A significant size difference can disrupt cambial contact, hindering the formation of a functional vascular connection. Smaller scions often struggle to establish contact effectively, contributing to graft failure.

**Question 9:**  Explain how wind exposure exacerbates the problem of desiccation in grafted plants.?
**Answer:** Wind dramatically increases water loss from the exposed graft union through increased evaporation. This heightened transpiration rate accelerates desiccation, weakening the graft union and increasing the likelihood of failure.

**Question 10:**  Considering the long-term maintenance of a grafted plant, what is the significance of regularly inspecting the graft union for signs of desiccation or disease?
**Answer:**  Regular inspection allows for early detection of problems like desiccation or disease, enabling timely intervention – such as applying wax or addressing underlying issues – and ultimately maximizing the graft's survival rate and productivity.
