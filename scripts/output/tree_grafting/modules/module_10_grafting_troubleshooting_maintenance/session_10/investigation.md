## Research Question 1: How does rootstock vigor influence graft union success in *Malus* species?

**Methodology:** This investigation will employ a controlled experiment utilizing three *Malus* species – *Malus domestica* (apple), *Malus pumila* (pear), and *Malus baccata* (crab apple) – each with varying levels of inherent vigor, as determined through previous growth rate measurements.  Thirty seedlings of each species will be selected.  Seedlings will be grown under identical conditions (soil, light, watering) for six months.  At six months, a 10cm scion of *Malus domestica* will be grafted onto the rootstock. Thirty grafts per rootstock species will be made.  The grafts will be monitored weekly for six months, recording visual indicators of graft success (e.g., callus formation, vascular connection signs) and overall scion health (leaf color, growth rate).  Measurements of scion diameter, leaf area, and stem length will be taken monthly.  Statistical analysis (ANOVA) will be performed on the collected data to determine the correlation between rootstock vigor and graft success rates.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that *Malus pumila* (pear), a generally more vigorous rootstock, will exhibit a higher rate of successful graft union compared to *Malus baccata* (crab apple), a slower-growing, less vigorous species.  The statistical analysis is expected to reveal a significant positive correlation between rootstock vigor and graft success, supporting the hypothesis that vigorous rootstocks provide a more favorable environment for scion establishment. This data will inform optimal rootstock selection for grafting *Malus* species, leading to improved orchard productivity.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of elevated soil temperature on callus formation and vascular cambium activity in *Prunus* rootstocks?

**Methodology:**  This research will explore the impact of elevated soil temperature on graft union development. Sixty *Prunus* rootstocks (specifically *Prunus avium* – cherry) of comparable size and health will be utilized. The rootstocks will be divided into two groups: a control group (maintained at ambient soil temperature – 20°C) and an experimental group (maintained at 28°C).  Ten scions of *Prunus domestica* (plum) will be grafted onto each rootstock. The grafts will be meticulously monitored over an eight-week period. The experimental group's soil temperature will be regulated using buried heating cables. Measurements of callus tissue thickness at the graft interface will be taken weekly using digital calipers.  Photographic documentation will track cambium activity (observable vascular changes). Quantitative analysis of leaf chlorophyll content will be conducted as an indirect measure of scion health.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that elevated soil temperature (28°C) will accelerate callus formation initially, but this enhanced activity will be unsustainable, ultimately leading to slower scion growth and reduced vascular cambium function due to heat stress. We predict that the control group, maintaining a stable, cooler temperature, will exhibit more consistent and robust graft union development, demonstrating superior scion health and photosynthetic capacity.

## Research Question 3: How can we accurately measure vascular integration success at the graft interface in *Citrus* rootstocks?

**Methodology:** This research will develop a non-destructive method for assessing vascular integration at the graft interface of *Citrus* rootstocks. Twenty *Citrus sinensis* (orange) rootstocks will be selected based on similar size and health. Each rootstock will receive a one-bud scion of *Citrus limon* (lemon). The graft junctions will be scanned using a high-resolution confocal laser scanner. The resultant 3D images will be analyzed using image processing software, specifically focusing on the identification and quantification of vascular channels penetrating the callus tissue.  Measurements will be taken of channel diameter, channel length, and overall vascular network density.  The scan will be repeated weekly over a four-week period, providing a longitudinal dataset for tracking integration progress.

**Expected Outcomes:** We expect that the confocal microscopy method will provide a precise and objective measure of vascular integration success, far superior to visual inspection.  We anticipate that the data will reveal a quantifiable relationship between vascular network density and graft success, potentially enabling us to predict graft outcomes more accurately.  Furthermore, the longitudinal data will provide invaluable insights into the dynamic processes of vascularization during graft union formation.
