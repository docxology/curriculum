# Grafting Troubleshooting & Maintenance - Laboratory Exercise 10

## Lab Focus: Desiccation

---

**Module: Grafting Troubleshooting & Maintenance**
**Lab Number: 10**
**Lab Focus: Desiccation**

**1. Brief Background (98 words)**

Following our discussion on graft failure causes, we now focus on desiccation – the leading culprit. Graft unions are inherently porous and vulnerable to environmental stressors. The large surface area of the graft tissue, combined with minimal natural protection, facilitates rapid water loss. This desiccation severely impacts cambial activity, hindering the formation of callus and, ultimately, successful vascular connection between the scion and rootstock. This lab will provide hands-on experience in identifying and mitigating desiccation-related graft failures, reinforcing preventative measures learned previously. [INSTRUCTOR: Brief visual aid – image of a desiccated graft union].

**2. Lab Objectives (4 bullet points)**

*   Observe and document the effects of desiccation on a newly grafted scion.
*   Apply grafting wax to protect a newly grafted scion.
*   Compare the appearance of a properly protected graft union versus a desicated union.
*   Quantify the amount of grafting wax applied.

**3. Materials and Equipment (Organized by Category)**

*   **Grafts:**
    *   10 Newly grafted scions (Apple, Pear, or similar fruit species – approx. 10-15cm length) with established unions (completed grafting technique). [INSTRUCTOR: Ensure unions are stable, not immediately failing]
    *   10 Rootstock Plants (same species as scions).
*   **Grafting Supplies:**
    *   Grafting Wax (200g, Temperature Sensitive – 60-70°C)
    *   Heat Source: Hot Plate or Heat Gun (with adjustable temperature setting) – 65-75°C
    *   Small Brushes (for applying wax) – 2
    *   Small Spatulas/Knives (for wax application) – 2
*   **Tools:**
    *   Cutting Tools: Sharp Knife (scalpel or grafting knife) - 2
    *   Ruler/Measuring Tape (cm)
    *   Forceps - 2
*   **Miscellaneous:**
    *   Paper Towels
    *   Spray Bottle with Water (for light misting) – 1

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

⚠️ **Chemical Hazard:** Grafting wax contains resin and may cause skin irritation. Avoid contact with eyes and skin.
⚠️ **Thermal Hazard:** Hot wax and heat gun pose a burn risk. Use caution and avoid direct contact. [INSTRUCTOR: Demonstrate proper use of the heat source.]
⚠️ **Sharp Object Hazard:** Cutting tools pose a laceration risk. Use caution and maintain a stable work surface. [INSTRUCTOR: Demonstrate safe cutting techniques.]
⚠️ **General Lab Safety:** Wear appropriate closed-toe shoes. [INSTRUCTOR: Review standard lab safety protocols].

**5. Procedure (Numbered Steps)**

1.  Divide students into groups of 2-3.
2.  Each group receives 2 grafted scions and 2 rootstock plants.
3.  Carefully examine each scion for signs of desiccation (wilting, shriveling, discoloration). Record initial observations.
4.  Using the heat gun or hot plate, gently warm approximately 50g of grafting wax to 65-70°C. Ensure consistent temperature.
5.  Apply a generous coat of warm grafting wax to the graft union of one scion, covering the entire exposed graft tissue.  [INSTRUCTOR: Demonstrate the proper application technique – smooth, even coat]. 
6.  Repeat step 5 for the second scion.
7.  Observe and record changes in the appearance of the wax-coated grafts compared to the uncoated grafts over the following 24 hours.
8.  Clean up work area, dispose of waste materials according to lab protocols.

**6. Data Collection (Template)**

| Scion/Rootstock | Initial Observations (Appearance, Color, Turgor) | Wax Application (Amount/Method) | 24 Hour Observations (Appearance, Color, Turgor) | Notes/Conclusions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Scion A/Rootstock 1 |  |  |  |  |
| Scion B/Rootstock 2 |  |  |  |  |

**7. Analysis Questions (5 questions)**

1.  Describe the appearance of a graft union that has been successfully protected from desiccation.
2.  What is the primary biological consequence of desiccation on a newly grafted scion?
3.  Explain how waxing the graft union mitigates the effects of desiccation.
4.  How does the color of a desiccated graft union differ from a healthy one?
5.  If a graft union shows signs of desiccation, what are two immediate steps you would take to attempt to salvage the graft?

**8. Expected Results (Student Observations)**

Students should observe that the wax-coated grafts retain their turgor and exhibit a healthy color, while the uncoated grafts will demonstrate wilting, shriveling, and discoloration (brown/grey) due to water loss.  The wax-coated grafts will appear hydrated and maintain the vibrant color characteristic of the scion. [INSTRUCTOR: Expected 100% wax application will be observed].
