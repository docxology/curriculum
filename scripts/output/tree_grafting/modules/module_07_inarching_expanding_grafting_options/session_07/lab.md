**Module: Inarching – Expanding Grafting Options**
**Lab Number: 7**
**Lab Focus: Rootstock Selection**

**1. Brief Background (98 words)**

Following our exploration of traditional grafting methods, this lab introduces inarching, a technique utilizing the natural growth of the rootstock. Unlike whip and tongue or cleft grafts requiring precise surface preparation, inarching employs a side shoot as the primary attachment point. This approach is particularly advantageous for established trees, minimizing rootstock removal. Successful inarching hinges on selecting a compatible rootstock and precisely timing the grafting process to ensure robust graft union formation. This lab will focus on the initial, critical step of rootstock selection, setting the stage for a successful inarching graft. [INSTRUCTOR: Briefly review lecture content emphasizing the difference between inarching and other grafting techniques.]

**2. Lab Objectives**

*   Identify suitable rootstock species for inarching based on criteria discussed.
*   Select a healthy rootstock exhibiting appropriate side shoot development.
*   Prepare a scion for inarching.
*   Apply a grafting wrap to secure the scion onto the rootstock side shoot.
*   Document graft union characteristics.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   **Rootstocks:** 10 *Malus domestica* (Red Delicious) rootstocks, 3-5 years old, approximately 60-80 cm tall. (Quantity: 10)
*   **Scions:** 10 *Malus domestica* (Red Delicious) scions, 6-8 weeks old. (Quantity: 10)
*   **Grafting Tape:** Standard grafting wrap, 10cm wide, 2 meters length. (Quantity: 2 rolls)
*   **Pruning Shears:** Sharp, bypass pruning shears, calibrated for 10mm cuts. (Quantity: 2 sets)
*   **Scalpel:** For precise scion preparation. (Quantity: 1)
*   **Wax:** Grafting wax, 100g container. (Quantity: 1)
*   **Clean Cloths/Sponges:** For wiping grafts. (Quantity: 3)
*   **Spray Bottles:** Filled with water. (Quantity: 2)
*   **Gloves:** Disposable nitrile gloves (Quantity: 10 pairs)

**4. Safety Considerations ⚠️**

*   **Sharp Objects:** Scalpels and pruning shears are sharp. Use with extreme caution. [INSTRUCTOR: Demonstrate proper use and handling techniques.]
*   **Potential for Cuts:** Pruning shears can cause cuts. [INSTRUCTOR: Emphasize slow, controlled cuts.]
*   **Biological Hazards:** Rootstocks may harbor pathogens. [INSTRUCTOR: Emphasize thorough hand washing before and after the experiment.]
*   **Chemical Exposure:** Grafting wax can cause skin irritation. [INSTRUCTOR: Use gloves when handling wax.]

PPE Requirements: Disposable nitrile gloves, safety glasses or goggles.

**5. Procedure**

1.  **Rootstock Selection:** Examine each *Malus domestica* rootstock. Select one rootstock demonstrating at least two well-developed side shoots (approximately 1-2 cm diameter) growing perpendicularly to the main stem.  Select rootstock #1.
2.  **Scion Preparation:** Using the scalpel, carefully excise a 5cm long section from the base of a healthy *Malus domestica* scion. Create a wedge cut approximately 45 degrees.
3.  **Grafting Application:**  Position the scion against the selected side shoot on rootstock #1. Ensure the base of the scion is touching the bark.
4.  **Secure the Graft:** Apply a continuous strip of grafting wrap around the scion and rootstock, starting at the base of the scion and wrapping upwards. Apply firm, consistent pressure to ensure good contact. Overlap each wrap approximately 1cm.
5.  **Wax Application (Optional):**  Apply a thin layer of grafting wax over the graft union to seal it and provide a protective barrier. [INSTRUCTOR: Demonstrate wax application technique.]
6.  **Post-Grafting Care:** Gently spray the graft union with water to hydrate the tissues. [INSTRUCTOR: Stress the importance of consistent moisture.]

**6. Data Collection**

| Observation                     | Rootstock #1 (Side Shoot) | Scion  |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------- | :----- |
| Side Shoot Diameter (mm)        |                           |        |
| Scion Diameter (mm)             |                           |        |
| Graft Union Contact (Good/Fair/Poor) |                           |        |
| Bark Color (Description)        |                           |        |
| Presence of Callus (Days After) |                           |        |
| Overall Graft Union Appearance|                           |        |

**7. Analysis Questions**

1.  Why is selecting a rootstock with well-developed side shoots crucial for inarching?
2.  Describe the importance of good contact between the scion and the rootstock side shoot in achieving a successful graft.
3.  How might the choice of rootstock affect the overall health and vigor of the grafted tree?
4.  What potential challenges could arise if the side shoot on the rootstock is diseased or damaged?
5.  Explain how the 'weave together' concept of inarching relates to the technique’s success.

**8. Expected Results**

Students should observe a clear point of contact between the scion and the rootstock side shoot.  Within 7-14 days, a callus (protective tissue) should begin to form at the graft union. The rootstock side shoot should remain green and healthy. The grafted union should appear firm and well-integrated. (Note: Callus formation varies depending on environmental conditions – 7-14 days is a target range).  The process highlights the ability to utilize the existing growth habit of the rootstock, reducing the need for extensive rootstock modification.
