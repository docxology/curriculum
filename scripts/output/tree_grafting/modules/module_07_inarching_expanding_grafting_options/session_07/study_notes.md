## Introduction

Welcome back to the Inarching – Expanding Grafting Options module. In our previous sessions, we’ve explored traditional grafting techniques – whip and tongue, cleft, and saddle grafts – focusing on their applications and successes. Today, we’re shifting our focus to a distinctly different, yet increasingly valuable, method: inarching. Inarching, derived from the Japanese term meaning ‘to weave together’, represents a grafting technique where a scion is attached directly to a side shoot of the rootstock. This approach offers significant advantages, particularly when working with established trees, allowing for the propagation of desirable cultivars without the need for extensive rootstock removal. Understanding inarching requires a nuanced approach, and we’ll delve into the critical considerations that dictate its success. We'll begin by examining the foundational principles, moving towards a detailed examination of rootstock selection and the intricate timing necessary for optimal graft contact.

## Additional Points

*   Inarching is particularly suitable for grafting fruit trees, ornamental plants, and other woody perennials.
*   Careful observation of the graft union is essential – look for signs of vascular cambium activity, such as the formation of new vascular bundles.
*   Proper sanitation – using clean tools and minimizing contamination – is crucial to prevent disease transmission.
