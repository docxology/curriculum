## Introduction

Welcome back to the Inarching – Expanding Grafting Options module. In our previous sessions, we’ve explored traditional grafting techniques – whip and tongue, cleft, and saddle grafts – focusing on their applications and successes. Today, we’re shifting our focus to a distinctly different, yet increasingly valuable, method: inarching. Inarching, derived from the Japanese term meaning ‘to weave together’, represents a grafting technique where a scion is attached directly to a side shoot of the rootstock. This approach offers significant advantages, particularly when working with established trees, allowing for the propagation of desirable cultivars without the need for extensive rootstock removal. Understanding inarching requires a nuanced approach, and we’ll delve into the critical considerations that dictate its success. We'll begin by examining the foundational principles, moving towards a detailed examination of rootstock selection and the intricate timing necessary for optimal graft contact.

## Main Topic 1: The Inarching Technique – Procedure

Inarching fundamentally relies on the natural growth habit of the rootstock. Unlike other grafting methods that force a scion onto a prepared surface, inarching leverages the existing side shoots. The process can be broken down into several key steps. First, the rootstock must be mature enough to support the scion. Second, a healthy side shoot is selected on the rootstock. This shoot should be appropriately sized, demonstrating vigorous growth, and free from disease or defects. Third, the scion, which has been prepared and potentially induced to root (if necessary), is carefully positioned against the side shoot. Fourth, a grafting wrap or specialized grafting tape is applied to secure the scion and rootstock together, maintaining consistent pressure. Finally, the entire graft union is protected from desiccation and excessive sunlight using a grafting shield or similar covering. The success of inarching hinges upon creating a robust **graft contact area**, which we will discuss in detail.

## Main Topic 2: Rootstock Selection for Inarching

The selection of the rootstock is arguably the most critical step in the inarching process. The rootstock provides the foundational support and influences the scion's overall vigor, disease resistance, and adaptability. For inarching, specific rootstock characteristics are highly beneficial. Consider a situation where you are inarching a delicate, fine-fruited apple cultivar onto a vigorous, disease-resistant rootstock. Selecting a rootstock known for vigorous growth would likely overwhelm the scion, hindering fruit production.  For instance, a dwarfing rootstock, such as M27 for apples, is often ideal.  It limits the scion's size, controlling fruit production and making harvesting easier. Similarly, selecting a rootstock resistant to soil-borne pathogens prevalent in your region is crucial.  Another example would be choosing a rootstock tolerant of heavy clay soils if your planting site is particularly prone to compaction. The rootstock's root system will directly impact the scion’s ability to access water and nutrients. Therefore, selecting a rootstock whose physiological characteristics complement the scion’s requirements is paramount.  In essence, the rootstock provides the foundation for the new tree’s success.

## Main Topic 3: Timing of Grafting – The Critical Window

The timing of grafting in the inarching technique is far more sensitive than in some other grafting methods.  Unlike whip and tongue grafts where the exact timing of the cut is less critical, inarching relies heavily on the physiological responsiveness of the tissues.  Generally, grafting should be performed during the active vegetative growth period of both the rootstock and the scion.  This typically corresponds to the bud break stage, when the tree is actively producing new growth. For example, apple trees are often grafted in early spring, coinciding with the swelling of flower buds.  However, the specific timing will vary depending on the species and cultivar.  Consider the case of a peach tree; grafting may need to be delayed until after the initial frost, as the peach rootstock is more sensitive to cold damage. It’s important to note that excessive early growth on the rootstock can be detrimental, masking the graft union and reducing the likelihood of successful fusion. A further key consideration is the size of the side shoot relative to the scion.  If the side shoot is too small, it may not provide sufficient support for the scion. Conversely, if the side shoot is too large, it can inhibit the scion’s growth.  Careful observation of the rootstock's development is therefore crucial.

## Main Topic 4: Creating a Strong Graft Contact Area – Mechanisms & Considerations

As we’ve established, the success of inarching hinges on establishing a robust **graft contact area** – the point where the scion cambium and rootstock cambium successfully unite. These cambial layers are responsible for producing new vascular tissue, forming the graft union. The key mechanisms involved are cell division and differentiation.  The success of this union relies on precise alignment of the cambial cells.  Factors influencing this alignment include the angle at which the scion is attached to the side shoot, the pressure applied during wrapping, and the overall health of the tissues. Consider, for instance, a slight misalignment. Even a small deviation can disrupt the cambial contact, hindering the formation of vascular connections. Applying consistent pressure through the grafting wrap is vital; too little pressure and the tissues won’t fuse, while excessive pressure can damage the delicate cambial cells. Furthermore, the condition of the tissues is paramount. Clean, healthy tissue is far more likely to establish a successful graft contact area.  Factors such as fungal infections or insect damage can significantly impair this process.

## Main Topic 5: Common Challenges and Troubleshooting

Despite its elegance, inarching isn't without its challenges. One common issue is graft rejection, where the rootstock recognizes the scion as a foreign entity and actively attempts to exclude it.  This can be mitigated by ensuring a strong graft contact area and, if necessary, applying a grafting sealant to create a physical barrier. Another challenge is competition between the scion and rootstock for resources. This can occur if the rootstock is excessively vigorous, overpowering the scion. Careful rootstock selection is crucial in addressing this. Finally, irregular growth patterns on the rootstock, such as the formation of multiple side shoots, can complicate the grafting process.  Consider the case of a particularly bushy rootstock; precisely selecting and positioning the scion is considerably more difficult.  Regular monitoring of the graft union is essential.

## Main Topic 6: Examples of Successful Inarching Applications

Let’s examine a few concrete examples.  For instance, the propagation of many elite grape varieties is successfully achieved through inarching onto established rootstocks that confer resistance to phylloxera, the devastating root pest.  Another example is the propagation of ornamental cherry trees, where fine-flowered cultivars are often grafted onto vigorous rootstocks to control their size and shape.  Furthermore, inarching has been successfully utilized in the commercial propagation of certain citrus varieties, particularly for achieving specific fruit characteristics while maintaining the desired rootstock traits.  Finally, consider the use of inarching in the restoration of damaged orchards – rapidly propagating desirable cultivars onto existing, healthy rootstocks.

## Summary

Today’s session focused on the inarching grafting technique, highlighting its distinct advantages and critical considerations. We’ve explored the importance of rootstock selection – emphasizing the need for a rootstock whose physiological characteristics complement the scion’s requirements. The timing of grafting was addressed, stressing the sensitivity of this process to the active vegetative growth of both the rootstock and scion. Most importantly, we underscored the pivotal role of establishing a robust **graft contact area** – the foundation for successful vascular fusion.  Through careful attention to these factors, inarching represents a valuable tool in the propagation of a wide range of horticultural species. Remember, success in inarching relies on meticulous planning, careful execution, and continuous observation.
