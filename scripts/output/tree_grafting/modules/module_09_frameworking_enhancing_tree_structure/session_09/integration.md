**Session Notes: Framework Grafting – Principles and Integration**

This session’s focus on framework grafting connects to Module 2’s exploration of plant tissue differentiation, specifically the role of the cambium layer in generating new vascular tissue. The principles of cell division and vascular development directly underpin the success of grafting, as a robust connection requires successful fusion of cambium cells from both rootstock and scion (Module 2). Furthermore, the concepts covered here relate to Module 3's discussion of plant hormones – particularly auxin – as these regulate cell growth and differentiation within the graft union. Optimal grafting relies on balanced auxin signaling to establish a stable connection and promote vascular integration (Module 3). Finally, this session builds on Module 1’s foundation regarding plant anatomy and physiology – understanding the structural components of a tree and how they function is crucial for effectively manipulating growth through grafting techniques.

This session integrates with Module 4's exploration of plant genetics by highlighting the importance of compatible genotypes for successful grafting. While grafting itself is a physical process, genetic factors can influence the graft’s ability to heal and integrate. Certain rootstocks are selected based on their genetic characteristics that promote vigorous growth and resilience, contributing to the overall vigor of the grafted plant. This relates directly to the selective breeding practices discussed in Module 4.
