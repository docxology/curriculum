## Lab Focus: Scion Size & Placement

---

**Module: Frameworking – Enhancing Tree Structure**
**Lab Number: 9**
**Lab Focus: Scion Size & Placement**

**1. Brief Background (95 words)**

This laboratory exercise builds upon the lecture’s introduction to framework grafting, emphasizing the critical role of scion size and placement in achieving graft stability.  Framework grafting mimics natural processes by creating a robust connection between a vigorous rootstock and a controlled scion.  The success of this technique – and all grafting – is directly tied to the ability of the scion to withstand the forces generated by its growth relative to the rootstock’s strength.  Students will manipulate scion size and placement to understand the direct relationship between these factors and the potential for graft failure.

**2. Lab Objectives (4 bullet points)**

*   Select and prepare scions of varying sizes for framework grafting.
*   Apply framework grafting techniques to multiple rootstock samples.
*   Record observations regarding scion size and rootstock characteristics.
*   Evaluate the impact of scion size on initial graft stability.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   **Rootstocks:** 10 x 1-year-old ‘Dwarf Willow’ rootstocks (approximately 60-80 cm tall) – pre-grafted with a straight, smooth basal area.
*   **Scions:**
    *   Small Scions: 10 x ‘Dwarf Apple’ scions (approximately 5-7.5 cm long, pencil-sized)
    *   Medium Scions: 10 x ‘Dwarf Apple’ scions (approximately 10-12.5 cm long, thumb-sized)
    *   Large Scions: 10 x ‘Dwarf Apple’ scions (approximately 15-17.5 cm long, index-finger sized)
*   **Binding Materials:**  30 x 20 cm strips of cotton twill tape (3cm wide) – pre-cut.
*   **Utility Knife:**  Sharp, single-edged grafting knife. [INSTRUCTOR: Ensure all knives are properly sharpened and maintained]
*   **Cutting Boards:** 3 x Wooden cutting boards (approximately 30cm x 40cm)
*   **Pruning Shears:** 2 x Sharp pruning shears.
*   **Water Spray Bottles:** 3 x Small spray bottles.
*   **Gloves:** Disposable nitrile gloves (10 pairs).
*   **Work Surface Protection:**  Heavy-duty tarp (3m x 3m)

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

*   ⚠️ **Sharp Objects:** Exercise extreme caution when handling the utility knife.  Always cut away from yourself and others. [INSTRUCTOR: Demonstrate proper knife handling technique].
*   ⚠️ **Biological Hazards:** Rootstocks may harbor sap-borne pathogens. Avoid direct skin contact with rootstock surfaces. Wear gloves at all times.
*   ⚠️ **Potential for Splashes:**  Water spray bottles may cause splashes. Maintain a safe distance from others.
*   ⚠️ **Material Disposal:** Dispose of used nitrile gloves and cutting board scraps in the designated biohazard container.
*   PPE:  Nitrile gloves, safety glasses (required), lab coat or apron.

**5. Procedure (6 steps)**

1.  **Scion Preparation:** Using the utility knife, carefully excise a 5 cm section of each scion, making a clean, angled cut.  [INSTRUCTOR:  Demonstrate proper scion cutting technique – a smooth, angled cut is crucial].
2.  **Rootstock Preparation:**  Gently clean the basal area of each rootstock with a damp cloth.
3.  **Grafting Application:** Align the scion with the rootstock, ensuring the cut ends meet.  Apply a strip of cotton twill tape securing the scion to the rootstock, overlapping the tape by approximately 2.5 cm. Secure the tape tightly, but not so tightly as to restrict growth.
4.  **Tape Overlap:**  Overlap a second strip of cotton twill tape over the first, securing the scion and rootstock.
5.  **Initial Watering:** Gently spray the grafted union with water to hydrate the tissues.
6.  **Observation & Recording:**  Observe the grafts and record initial observations in the data collection table.

**7. Analysis Questions (4 questions)**

1.  How did the size of the scion influence the initial fit against the rootstock?
2.  Considering the lecture, why is it important to minimize vertical force exerted on the rootstock during the grafting process?
3.  Based on your observations, which scion size resulted in the most secure graft union and why?
4.  How might increasing the binding strength of the tape affect graft stability – and what potential drawbacks might this have?

**8. Expected Results (Descriptive)**

Students should observe that smaller scions initially provide a closer fit and more immediate contact with the rootstock.  Grafts with smaller scions are expected to demonstrate initial stability, although may require more frequent monitoring.  Larger scions will likely have a less secure initial fit, requiring a greater binding force to establish a stable union.  Students will likely observe that the fit between the scion and rootstock is a primary factor in determining graft success.  [INSTRUCTOR:  Discuss the concept of “mechanical occlusion” – the tighter the fit, the greater the chance of a successful union].
