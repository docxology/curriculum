are three open questions designed to represent current research frontiers, formatted exactly as requested, along with the necessary context and research type citations:

## Open Question 1: What is the precise mechanism by which induced systemic resistance (ISR) – triggered by beneficial microbial interactions – translates into long-term, broad-spectrum protection against subsequent pathogen attacks in woody plants?

Context:  Research increasingly demonstrates that plants can “remember” past infections and proactively bolster their defenses. However, the detailed molecular pathways underpinning ISR, particularly its longevity and cross-protection against diverse pathogens, remain incompletely understood.  Determining this precise mechanism is crucial for developing sustainable, preventative strategies in forestry and agriculture.

Current research: Systems immunology, microbiome research, plant-microbe signaling pathways (primarily focusing on transcriptomics and metabolomics approaches).

## Open Question 2: How does the incorporation of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology into rootstock selection for dwarfing fruit trees – specifically targeting genes involved in root architecture and auxin signaling –  impact not only fruit yield and quality, but also the plant's ability to withstand drought stress and salinity?

Context: Genetic modification offers powerful tools for manipulating plant traits.  Applying CRISPR to rootstock selection for fruit trees presents a significant opportunity to enhance productivity and resilience.  However, careful investigation is needed to understand the potential unintended consequences of altering key plant hormone pathways, especially in the context of abiotic stress.

Current research:  Plant genetic engineering, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, gene editing techniques (CRISPR-Cas9), stress physiology (abiotic stress tolerance).

## Open Question 3: What are the long-term implications of utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) – particularly deep learning models – for predicting and managing the development of fungal diseases in complex, multi-factorial forest ecosystems, considering variables like tree species composition, climate change impacts, and insect herbivory?

Context:  Forest ecosystems are facing unprecedented challenges due to climate change and invasive species.  Traditional predictive models often struggle to capture the intricate interactions within these systems. AI offers the potential to analyze vast datasets and identify hidden patterns, but questions remain around model reliability, data biases, and the integration of ecological understanding.

Current research: Ecological modeling, machine learning (deep learning), remote sensing, biodiversity monitoring, climate change impact assessments.
