**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Which of the following best describes the term “scion” in grafting?
A) The rootstock's vascular system
B) The desired new growth being attached
C) The protective sealant used during grafting
D) The pruning shears used for shaping the tree?
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** In grafting, the scion refers to the selected piece of plant (usually a shoot) that is joined to the rootstock, providing the new growth for the grafted tree. This contrasts with the rootstock, which provides the foundational support.

**Question 3:** What is the primary benefit of utilizing binding strength in framework grafting?
A) To enhance the aesthetic appearance of the graft union
B) To increase the rate of nutrient uptake by the scion
C) To create a strong and stable connection between the scion and rootstock
D) To stimulate the production of chlorophyll in the newly formed leaves?
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Adequate binding strength is crucial for a graft's stability, ensuring a robust connection and resisting forces generated by growth, wind, and other environmental factors.  A weak union is likely to fail.

**Question 4:**  Why is it important to select a scion size appropriate for the rootstock in framework grafting?
A)  A smaller scion will always result in a stronger graft
B)  An oversized scion creates excessive upward pressure and potential instability
C)  The rootstock’s growth rate determines the optimal scion size
D)  Scion size has no impact on graft stability
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** A scion that is too large can outgrow the rootstock, applying excessive force and compromising the graft's stability, leading to failure. Careful selection of size is key for a successful union.

**Question 5:**  What is the main purpose of utilizing a grafting knife during framework grafting?
A) To inject growth hormones into the scion
B) To precisely cut and join the scion and rootstock tissue
C) To measure the circumference of the rootstock
D) To apply binding tape to the graft union?
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** A grafting knife is used to make clean, angled cuts, exposing the cambium layer of both the scion and rootstock, enabling the tissues to fuse and create a vascular connection.

**Question 6:** Briefly describe the relationship between scion size and the potential for graft failure?
**Answer:** Smaller scions are less likely to induce excessive upward pressure on the rootstock, reducing the risk of instability and graft failure. Conversely, a large scion can quickly overpower the rootstock, leading to a weak and unstable union.

**Question 7:** Explain how framework grafting mimics natural processes in tree development?
**Answer:** Framework grafting replicates the way trees naturally grow, strengthening the base (rootstock) while allowing for controlled growth and shaping of the desired new branches (scion).  This approach provides robust support and a more aesthetically pleasing form, much like how a tree's natural structure develops.

**Question 8:**  Discuss one real-world application of framework grafting beyond simply shaping ornamental trees. Provide a specific example.?
**Answer:** Framework grafting is widely used in fruit tree production to create strong, productive scaffolds for fruit bearing branches.  For example, apple and pear trees are often grafted onto dwarfing rootstocks to control their size and improve fruit yield while maintaining a desirable shape.

**Question 9:**  Considering both scion size and binding strength, what are the two most critical factors for establishing a stable framework graft?
**Answer:** The most crucial elements are selecting a scion size appropriate for the rootstock, minimizing upward pressure, and applying sufficient binding strength to create a robust connection. Both factors must be carefully considered and balanced for a successful graft.

**Question 10:**  Explain how a well-established framework graft contributes to the overall health and longevity of a tree.?
**Answer:** A properly constructed framework graft provides structural support, enhances nutrient transport, and promotes balanced growth, thereby increasing the tree's resistance to disease, wind damage, and other environmental stressors, ultimately contributing to its long-term health and vitality.
