## Research Question 1: How does scion size influence the rate of vascular cambium contact during framework grafting of apple trees?

**Methodology:** This investigation will utilize a controlled experiment to assess the relationship between scion size and vascular cambium contact rate in *Malus domestica* (apple) framework grafting. Twenty apple trees (variety ‘Fuji’) were selected, and the rootstock was a standard dwarfing rootstock (M9).  Scions were prepared in three sizes: small (5 cm), medium (10 cm), and large (15 cm). Each size was replicated ten times.  Following grafting, the scion bases were monitored daily for 30 days. Vascular cambium contact was assessed by microscopic examination of tissue samples taken from the graft union at 7, 14, 21, and 30 days post-grafting.  Measurements of vascular tissue area and degree of fusion were recorded.  Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, and light exposure) were carefully controlled across all treatments.  Statistical analysis (ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests) was performed to determine significant differences in cambium contact rates between scion sizes.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that medium-sized scions (10 cm) will exhibit the highest rate of vascular cambium contact, followed by small (5 cm) and then large (15 cm) scions. This is due to the optimal balance between sufficient vascular tissue for successful graft union and minimal pressure on the rootstock.  The statistical analysis is expected to demonstrate a significant positive correlation between scion size and cambium contact rate, with the medium-sized scions showing a significantly higher contact area compared to the small and large scions.  This data will provide a quantitative understanding of the critical parameters influencing successful framework grafting of apple trees.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of varying binding strength (tape pressure) on the initial graft union stability of pear trees ( *Pyrus communis*)?

**Methodology:**  This study will explore the impact of different tape pressures on the initial stability of pear grafts. Forty-five *Pyrus communis* (‘Bartlett’) trees were used. Scions were grafted onto a standard rootstock. The experiment employed three tape pressure levels: low (1 kg), medium (3 kg), and high (5 kg). Each pressure level was replicated fifteen times. Following grafting, the graft unions were monitored visually and microscopically for 60 days.  Measurements of the graft union diameter and a qualitative assessment of tissue integration were recorded weekly.  The scions were subjected to a controlled wind exposure to simulate environmental stresses.  At 60 days, the grafted trees were carefully examined for signs of graft failure, with photographic documentation of any visible issues.  The data collected will be analyzed using ANOVA to determine the significance of the effect of tape pressure on graft union stability.

**Expected Outcomes:** We predict that a medium level of tape pressure (3 kg) will produce the most stable initial graft unions.  Too little pressure (1 kg) may result in insufficient tissue adhesion, while excessive pressure (5 kg) could potentially damage the delicate cambium tissue, leading to graft failure.  The study will provide valuable insights into the optimal tape pressure required for establishing robust initial graft unions in pear trees, contributing to improved grafting success rates.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the degree of vascular tissue integration following framework grafting of apple trees ( *Malus domestica*)?

**Methodology:** This investigation will establish a quantitative method for assessing vascular tissue integration post-grafting of apple trees. Twenty *Malus domestica* trees were grafted using a standardized framework grafting technique.  At 7, 14, 21, and 30 days post-grafting, tissue samples were excised from the graft union. These samples were prepared using microtomy techniques to produce thin sections.  The sections were then stained with a specialized dye (e.g., phloroglucinol) which preferentially stains vascular tissue.  A digital imaging system with calibrated software was used to measure the percentage of stained vascular tissue area within the graft union.  Multiple measurements were taken at each time point, and the data was analyzed statistically to determine the rate of vascular tissue integration. Control samples, where the scion was removed, were included to establish a baseline measurement.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that the percentage of stained vascular tissue area will increase over time, representing the gradual integration of the scion and rootstock vascular systems. The study will result in a standardized protocol for quantifying vascular tissue integration, facilitating a more objective assessment of graft success and contributing to a better understanding of the physiological processes involved in graft union formation. The methodology can be applied to other grafting systems.
