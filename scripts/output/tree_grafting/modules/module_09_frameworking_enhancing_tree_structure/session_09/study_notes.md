## Frameworking – Enhancing Tree Structure

**Introduction**

Welcome back to our module on frameworking, focusing on enhancing tree structure. In our previous sessions, we’ve explored various techniques for shaping and controlling tree growth – from cabling to branch collars. Today, we delve into a crucial grafting method: framework grafting, specifically designed to provide robust structural support and a more aesthetically pleasing tree form. This technique, while seemingly simple, relies on a fundamental understanding of graft stability. The goal is to create a strong, lasting union between the scion (the desired new growth) and the rootstock, mimicking a natural grafting process observed in nature. Think of it like reinforcing a building’s frame – the stronger the base, the more stable the structure. This session will cover scion size and placement, and critically, the relationship between binding strength and graft stability.

## Additional Points

*   **Binding Material**: Common binding materials include soft rubber tape, hemp cord, and nylon twine. The choice of material can affect the rate of cambium contact and the long-term stability of the graft.
*   **Regular Monitoring**: Regularly inspect grafted unions for signs of stress, such as wilting leaves or unusual branch growth. Early detection of problems allows for timely intervention.
*   **First Year Focus**: The first year following grafting is critical for graft stability. Provide adequate care, including watering, fertilization, and protection from harsh weather conditions.
