## Introduction

Welcome back to Advanced Grafting. In our previous sessions, we’ve established the fundamental principles of grafting – the union of two plants to create a single, genetically superior plant. We’ve explored various grafting techniques, including whip and tongue grafting and cleft grafting. Today, we’re focusing on a highly specialized technique: topworking. Topworking, unlike traditional grafting which involves joining entire plants, allows us to manipulate the crown and fruiting characteristics of established fruit trees. It’s essentially a controlled form of pruning combined with grafting, giving growers precise control over the tree’s architecture and fruit production. This session will delve into the technique itself, emphasizing the critical importance of scion selection and timing – factors that significantly impact success.

## Main Topic 1: Understanding Crown Architecture

The foundation of successful topworking lies in a solid understanding of **crown architecture**: the arrangement of branches, buds, and fruiting wood within the tree’s crown. Fruit trees exhibit a natural tendency to branch in specific ways, influenced by factors like sunlight exposure and the tree’s overall vigor.  A well-defined crown is essential for optimal fruit production and longevity.  The goal of topworking is to modify this natural architecture – for example, to encourage lateral branching for increased fruit production, or to reduce apical dominance, which is the suppression of lateral growth by the terminal bud. Consider an apple tree; without careful crown management, it can develop a single, dominant central leader, leading to a pyramid shape with limited fruit production.  Topworking aims to counter this by introducing new fruiting wood at desired locations.  Furthermore, understanding the tree’s inherent crown shape – whether it’s broadly pyramidal, vase-shaped, or spreading – is crucial. Different scion choices will behave differently depending on the pre-existing crown structure.

## Main Topic 2: Scion Selection – The Key to Success

The choice of scion is arguably the most critical aspect of topworking. The scion provides the new fruiting wood, and its genetic characteristics and growth habits will directly influence the resulting tree.  For example, when topworking a peach tree to increase fruit size, selecting a standard peach variety known for large fruit is essential. Conversely, if the objective is to create a more compact tree for small orchards, a dwarf variety would be the appropriate choice.  Scion selection should also consider compatibility with the rootstock, ensuring the new shoots will successfully integrate with the existing root system. Consider a scenario where a grower wants to enhance the fruit quality of a plum tree. Selecting a plum variety with superior color or flavor profiles is obviously key. The scion should also be appropriately sized – generally between 6-12 inches long – to facilitate a strong graft union. Furthermore, the scion’s growth habit – whether it's vigorous or more restrained – needs to align with the desired crown architecture.  Don’t overlook the importance of rootstock compatibility; a vigorous rootstock can overwhelm a delicate scion, leading to graft failure.

## Main Topic 3: Graft Placement – Technique and Precision

Successful graft placement is a meticulous process requiring precision. The general principle involves creating a "tongue" on the rootstock, a flap of bark approximately 1-2 inches long, and then sliding the scion’s bark over this tongue, creating a tight, secure union.  The graft must be positioned where the bark of the scion will cover the rootstock bark – this is vital for cambial contact, the critical point for graft fusion.  For instance, when grafting a standard apple variety onto a dwarf rootstock, the scion must be positioned low on the rootstock to minimize the overall tree size.  The cut surfaces should be clean and free of sap – sap can inhibit the formation of callus tissue, essential for graft union.  Applying grafting wax immediately after union creation seals the cut surfaces and prevents moisture loss, further promoting successful fusion.  Consider the angle of the cuts; a clean, angled cut promotes better cambial contact than a bluntly cut surface. Finally, ensure the graft is placed where the new growth will be exposed to adequate sunlight.

## Main Topic 4: Timing – The Window for Success

The timing of topworking is just as crucial as scion selection and placement. There are two primary periods when topworking is most successful: post-dormant (late winter/early spring) and during the active growing season.  Post-dormant topworking, performed after the tree has broken dormancy but before new growth begins, offers the most predictable results. This allows for better cambial contact and reduces the risk of the scion being shaded out by the rootstock. For example, topworking a pear tree in late February allows ample time for the graft union to establish before the tree begins rapid growth in the spring.  During the active growing season, topworking is possible but more challenging. Success depends on careful selection of scion size to avoid shading the rootstock and ensuring adequate sunlight exposure.  However, this method is favored when a rapid response is needed, such as stimulating fruit set in late summer.

## Main Topic 5: Troubleshooting Common Problems

Despite careful planning, graft failures can occur. Common problems include shading by the rootstock, insufficient cambial contact, and disease. For instance, if the rootstock is significantly larger than the scion, it will inevitably shade the scion, hindering its growth.  Another frequent issue is poorly-made grafts; a loose graft union will not effectively fuse, allowing water and nutrients to leak, ultimately leading to failure.  Disease, such as fungal infections, can also compromise graft union. Maintaining a clean environment, selecting disease-resistant rootstocks, and applying appropriate fungicides can mitigate these risks.  Consider a situation where a graft union appears swollen and discolored - this could indicate a fungal infection.

## Summary

In conclusion, topworking is a sophisticated technique that allows growers to manipulate the crown architecture and fruit production of established fruit trees. Successful topworking hinges on a confluence of factors: carefully selecting a compatible scion based on desired traits, placing it precisely to ensure adequate cambial contact, and timing the operation correctly. Remember, the rootstock’s inherent characteristics and the tree’s overall crown structure significantly influence the outcome.  By mastering these elements, you can effectively shape the future of your fruit trees, maximizing yields and fruit quality.  The key takeaways are: scion selection matters, placement requires precision, and timing is paramount.
