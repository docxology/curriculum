## Research Question 1: How does the age of the rootstock affect graft success rates in apple trees undergoing topworking?

**Methodology:** This investigation will quantitatively assess the impact of rootstock age on graft success. We will select ten apple rootstock varieties known to exhibit varying growth rates – young (1-2 years), mature (3-5 years), and older (6-8 years). For each variety, we will conduct a replicated experiment, grafting a standard apple cultivar (e.g., ‘Fuji’) onto each rootstock.  Each experiment will consist of 5 grafts. The grafts will be monitored weekly for six months. Success will be defined as observable scion growth (defined by leaf emergence and shoot length) and measurable via digital calipers. Data will be collected on scion shoot length, leaf area, and the presence/absence of visible signs of graft union (e.g., callus formation). Statistical analysis (ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests) will be performed to determine if significant differences in graft success rates exist between the different rootstock age groups. A control group of scions grafted onto a standardized, young rootstock will be included for comparison.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that younger rootstocks will initially demonstrate higher graft success rates, likely due to increased vascular cambium activity and enhanced nutrient uptake. However, we hypothesize that as the rootstocks age, this activity will decline, leading to reduced graft union strength and ultimately, lower success rates. We expect to observe a statistically significant negative correlation between rootstock age and graft success.  The data will provide concrete quantitative insights into the critical role of rootstock age in topworking, informing best practices for orchard management.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of varying levels of light intensity on the rate of scion growth following topworking in peach trees?

**Methodology:** This experiment will investigate the influence of light intensity on scion growth post-topworking in peach trees. Twenty peach trees of similar age and variety (e.g., ‘Elberta’) will be divided into four treatment groups (five trees per group). Trees will be grown in a controlled greenhouse environment. Light intensity will be manipulated using shade cloth – low intensity (50% reduction), medium intensity (75% reduction), high intensity (control – 100% natural light), and very high intensity (150% natural light).  Scion growth will be monitored weekly for eight weeks. Measurements will include scion shoot length, leaf area (using a leaf area meter), and the visual assessment of shoot vigor (using a scale of 1-5, with 5 representing the most vigorous growth). Photosynthetic rate will be measured non-destructively using a portable photosynthesis system. Data will be collected and analyzed using ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests.

**Expected Outcomes:** We predict that moderate light intensity will promote optimal scion growth, resulting in the highest rates of shoot elongation, leaf expansion, and photosynthetic activity.  Excessively low light intensity is expected to limit growth, while excessively high light intensity may induce stress responses and negatively affect scion health. The research will provide quantitative data on the ideal light conditions for maximizing scion growth following topworking in peach trees.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the strength of the graft union in apple trees after topworking?

**Methodology:**  This investigation will assess graft union strength using a combination of qualitative and quantitative measures. Twenty apple trees will be topworked using the whip and tongue graft technique. Following grafting, the graft unions will be assessed at weekly intervals for eight weeks. Qualitative assessment will involve visually inspecting the union for signs of a strong, healthy union (e.g., full callus formation, vascular tracing).  Quantitative measurements will be performed using a digital force gauge. A small, controlled force will be applied perpendicular to the graft union surface, and the force required to cause slight indentation or separation will be recorded. Measurements will be taken in triplicate at each graft union. Statistical analysis will be conducted to determine the average force required for union failure. Data will be correlated with visual observations to determine the relationship between force and visual indicators of union strength.

**Expected Outcomes:**  We expect to demonstrate a clear correlation between the force required to separate the graft union and the overall strength of the union. The research will provide a practical and measurable metric for assessing graft union strength, aiding in the identification of successful versus unsuccessful grafts and informing techniques for strengthening weak graft unions (e.g., application of sealant). This approach offers a reliable and objective method for monitoring graft integration.
