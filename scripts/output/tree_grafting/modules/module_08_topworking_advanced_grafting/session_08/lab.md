**Module: Topworking – Advanced Grafting – Lab 8: Graft Placement**

**Lab Number:** 8
**Lab Focus:** Graft Placement

**1. Brief Background (98 words)**

Following our lecture on advanced grafting techniques, this lab focuses on a specialized method: topworking. Unlike traditional grafting, topworking manipulates the crown architecture of an established fruit tree. Successful topworking hinges on selecting compatible scions and precisely positioning them to redirect growth. This technique allows growers to control branching patterns and fruit production by influencing apical dominance. This lab provides hands-on experience in applying these principles, emphasizing the critical role of graft placement in achieving the desired tree architecture. Accurate graft placement is the cornerstone of effective topworking.

**2. Lab Objectives**

*   Prepare the rootstock and scion for grafting.
*   Apply grafting wax accurately to secure the graft union.
*   Position scions onto the rootstock utilizing a whip and tongue graft.
*   Monitor graft placement for initial stability.
*   Document graft placement observations.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   **Rootstock:** 3-year-old ‘Fuji’ apple trees (3 trees) – 10cm diameter trunk.
*   **Scions:** ‘Gala’ apple scions (10cm length) – 10 scions.
*   Grafting Tape
*   Sharp Grafting Knife (maintained by [INSTRUCTOR])
*   Grafting Wax (melting point 55-60°C) - 100g
*   Heat Source (hot plate or heat gun – with temperature monitoring) - 60-70°C
*   Cutting Boards (3)
*   Sanitizing Solution (70% isopropyl alcohol)
*   Gloves (latex or nitrile) – 3 pairs
*   Safety Glasses – 3 pairs
*   Ruler or Measuring Tape (15cm)
*   Labeling Tape and Marker

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

⚠️ **Sharp Objects:** The grafting knife is extremely sharp. Use extreme caution. Cuts should always be made away from yourself and others. [INSTRUCTOR] will demonstrate proper knife handling techniques.
⚠️ **Heat:** The heat source (hot plate or heat gun) will operate at 60-70°C. Avoid direct contact with the heating element or melted wax. Use heat-resistant gloves.
⚠️ **Biological Hazards:** While no specific pathogens are anticipated, sanitization with 70% isopropyl alcohol is mandatory before handling rootstock and scions.
⚠️ **General Lab Safety:** Maintain a clean and organized work area. Report any accidents or injuries to [INSTRUCTOR] immediately.

**PPE Requirements:** Safety glasses, gloves, lab coat (provided).

**5. Procedure**

1.  **Rootstock Preparation:** Using the grafting knife, carefully make a long, sloping cut (approx. 10cm) in the rootstock trunk, approximately 15cm above the base. The cut should be made at a 45-degree angle.
2.  **Scion Preparation:**  Prepare the ‘Gala’ scion by making a matching whip and tongue cut, ensuring the tongue aligns with the rootstock cut.
3.  **Graft Union:** Carefully slide the ‘Gala’ scion tongue into the rootstock cut. Apply firm, downward pressure to ensure a tight fit.
4.  **Wax Application:** Immediately apply grafting wax to the graft union, covering the entire surface with a generous layer. Use a small brush or spatula to ensure complete coverage.  Allow wax to cool and harden, approximately 5 minutes.
5.  **Repeat:** Repeat steps 1-4 with 2 additional rootstock/scion combinations.

**6. Data Collection**

| Observation            | Rootstock 1 | Rootstock 2 | Rootstock 3 |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Wax Coverage           |             |             |             |
| Tongue Alignment        |             |             |             |
| Graft Union Stability  |             |             |             |
| Initial Observations (e.g., color, texture) |             |             |             |

**7. Analysis Questions**

1.  Why is precise tongue alignment crucial for a successful whip and tongue graft?
2.  Describe the importance of immediate wax application to the graft union.
3.  How does accurate scion selection relate to the desired outcome of topworking?
4.  What potential issues might arise if the wax application is incomplete?
5.  How does the angle of the initial rootstock cut influence graft success?

**8. Expected Results**

Students should observe a clear, well-waxed graft union with the ‘Gala’ tongue firmly embedded within the ‘Fuji’ rootstock. The graft union should appear stable, and the wax should provide a protective barrier. Variations in wax coverage or tongue alignment will impact graft success. A well-executed graft will begin to show initial signs of vascular connection within 7-14 days, evidenced by swelling at the graft union.
