**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Explain the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?
**Answer:** Prokaryotic cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles, while eukaryotic cells have both. Prokaryotes are generally smaller and simpler in structure.

**Question 3:** Which of the following best describes the process of osmosis?
A) The movement of solute molecules from a region of high concentration to low concentration.
B) The movement of water molecules across a semipermeable membrane from a region of high water potential to low water potential.
C) The movement of ions across a cell membrane through active transport.
D) The diffusion of gases across a membrane.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Osmosis is the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane, driven by differences in water potential. This movement occurs from areas of higher water potential to areas of lower potential.

**Question 4:** What is the purpose of grafting tape in whip and tongue grafting?
A) To sterilize the cut surfaces of the rootstock and scion.
B) To provide structural support and hold the graft union together.
C) To introduce nutrients into the wound area.
D) To stimulate cell division at the graft interface.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Grafting tape is used to physically secure the newly joined tissues, providing initial support while the cambium layers align and the graft union forms. This support is critical for successful fusion.

**Question 5:**  Why is a sharp, clean knife essential for successful grafting?
A) Dull blades induce unnecessary tissue damage.
B) Sharp knives only work with hardwood rootstocks.
C) Dull knives automatically promote faster callus formation.
D) A dull blade significantly reduces the rate of transpiration.
**Answer:** A
**Explanation:** A sharp knife minimizes tissue damage during the cutting process, allowing for clean, precise cuts that facilitate optimal tissue alignment and union development.

**Question 6:**  Describe the role of the cambium layer in the success of a whip and tongue graft?
**Answer:** The cambium layer is the crucial tissue that contains actively dividing cells. During a whip and tongue graft, the cambium layers of the rootstock and scion must align and fuse.  This allows for the continuous vascular connection, enabling water and nutrient transport between the two plants – essential for long-term graft survival.

**Question 7:**  How does the ‘tongue’ part of the whip and tongue graft contribute to the success of the graft?
**Answer:** The ‘tongue’ creates a continuous, aligned vascular connection between the rootstock and scion. This overlap allows the cambium layers to fuse, essentially creating a bridge for nutrient and water flow, supporting a robust and lasting graft union.

**Question 8:**  If the temperature of the rootstock and scion is too high when grafting, what is the most likely consequence?
**Answer:** Elevated temperatures can inhibit callus formation and disrupt the delicate alignment of the cambium layers. This ultimately reduces the chances of successful graft union by compromising the critical process of vascular integration.

**Question 9:**  Explain how maintaining a damp cloth around the graft union aids in the grafting process?
**Answer:** Damp cloths help to keep the cut surfaces moist, which is essential for callus formation—the initial tissue growth that bridges the gap between the rootstock and scion.  Moist conditions promote cell division and vascular reconnection.

**Question 10:**  Considering the lab procedure, why is precise blade angle control critical for whip and tongue grafting?
**Answer:** The blade angle directly impacts the undercut created during the cut.  An appropriately angled cut ensures a clean and deep enough undercut, facilitating proper cambium alignment and a successful vascular connection, which is fundamental to graft union formation.
