## Lab 2: Blade Angle – Whip & Tongue Grafting

**Module:** Basic Grafting Techniques: Whip & Tongue
**Lab Number:** 2
**Lab Focus:** Blade Angle

**Related Topics:** Tool Selection, Blade Angle, Correct Alignment

**Learning Objectives:**
*   Perform whip-and-tongue grafting on scion and rootstock material.
*   Adjust the blade angle to achieve a proper undercut.
*   Evaluate the alignment of vascular tissues during the grafting process.

**Materials and Equipment:**

*   **Rootstock:** 10 Wax Berry (Fragaria xananassa) plants, approximately 6-8 inches tall, with healthy buds.
*   **Scion Wood:** 10 Wax Berry (Fragaria xananassa) cuttings, 4-6 inches long, with 2-3 healthy buds.  Cut 1 week prior to grafting.
*   Grafting Knife: 1 per group of 2 students.
*   Grafting Tape: 1 roll per group of 2 students.
*   Damp Cloths: 2 per group of 2 students.
*   Wax: 100g grafting wax.
*   Clean, Damp Paper Towels
*   Cutting Boards (2 per group)
*   Permanent Marker
*   Safety Glasses (ANSI Z87.1)
*   Gloves (latex or nitrile)

**Safety Considerations:** ⚠️

*   **Sharp Blades:** Grafting knives are extremely sharp. Always cut *away* from yourself and others.  [INSTRUCTOR] – Demonstrate proper knife handling multiple times.
*   **Eye Protection:**  Mandatory use of ANSI Z87.1 safety glasses at all times during the procedure.
*   **Skin Contact:** Avoid prolonged skin contact with the grafting knife. Gloves are required.
*   **Wax Handling:**  Avoid inhaling wax fumes. Work in a well-ventilated area.
*   **Time-Sensitive Step:**  Rootstock and scion must be cool to the touch before grafting. Avoid using hot tools or working in direct sunlight.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Preparation (10 minutes):**  Each group receives a rootstock plant and scion cuttings.  Clean the cut ends of both the rootstock and scion with a damp cloth.
2.  **Blade Angle Assessment (5 minutes):**  Using a straight edge, examine the blade angle of your grafting knife. The ideal angle is approximately 45-60 degrees.  [INSTRUCTOR] - Provide visual aids demonstrating optimal angle.
3.  **Undercut Cut (10 minutes):** Select a point on the rootstock approximately 1 inch below the bud. Using the grafting knife, make an undercut cut, angling the blade at 45-60 degrees.  The cut should be approximately ½ inch long and slightly concave.
4.  **Tongue Cut (5 minutes):**  About ½ inch above the undercut, make a smooth, parallel cut across the rootstock, creating a “tongue.”
5.  **Scion Alignment (5 minutes):** Carefully slide the scion into the undercut, aligning the cambium layers of the scion and rootstock.
6.  **Secure the Graft (10 minutes):** Wrap the graft union tightly with grafting tape, ensuring good contact between the scion and rootstock. Use multiple layers of tape for security.
7.  **Wax Application (5 minutes):** Apply a thin layer of grafting wax over the entire graft union to seal and protect the cut surfaces.
8. **Repeat:** Repeat steps 3-7 on a second graft.

**Data Collection:**

| Observation                  |  Graft 1  | Graft 2 |
| :--------------------------- | :-------- | :------ |
| Blade Angle (approx. degrees)|           |         |
| Undercut Depth (inches)      |           |         |
| Scion Alignment (visual)     |           |         |
| Tape Contact (visual)        |           |         |
| Overall Union Appearance     |           |         |

**Analysis Questions:**

1.  How does the blade angle affect the size of the undercut?
2.  Why is it crucial to align the cambium layers during the scion insertion?
3.  Describe the role of the grafting tape in maintaining the graft union.
4.  What potential problems could arise if the blade angle is too steep or too shallow?
5.  How does the appearance of the graft union relate to its successful formation?

**Expected Results:**

Students should observe a well-aligned graft union with consistent cambium contact. The scion should be firmly held in place by the tape, and the entire union should appear tightly sealed with wax. Variations in alignment or the appearance of exposed cut surfaces indicate improper technique and may result in graft failure.  Proper alignment of cambium is indicated by visible vascular tissue contact.
