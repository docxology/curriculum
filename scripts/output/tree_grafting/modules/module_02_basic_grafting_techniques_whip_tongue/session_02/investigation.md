the research question set, formatted according to your specifications. I've aimed for clarity, conciseness, and direct applicability for undergraduate students.

## Research Question 1: How does the angle of the initial cut during whip and tongue grafting affect the speed of vascular connection formation?

**Methodology:**  This investigation will involve creating ten identical whip and tongue graft unions on *Malus domestica* (apple) rootstock.  Each graft will be performed with a slightly adjusted initial cut angle – ranging from 15 degrees to 45 degrees relative to the rootstock.  The cuts will be made using a sharp, sterile grafting knife.  Following the grafts, the union sites will be monitored daily for signs of vascular connection formation, specifically the presence of callus tissue and the appearance of green tissue at the interface.  Measurements of callus tissue diameter will be taken every three days for a total of 21 days. The data will be recorded in a spreadsheet. A statistical analysis (e.g., ANOVA) will be performed to determine if there is a significant correlation between the cut angle and the rate of vascular connection formation.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that the most efficient vascular connection will be achieved with an angle of approximately 30-40 degrees. We expect a faster rate of callus formation and earlier emergence of green tissue at the graft interface with steeper angles.  The statistical analysis will likely demonstrate a positive correlation between the cut angle and the speed of vascular connection, supporting the hypothesis that a specific cut angle optimizes the initial conditions for successful graft union.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of varying levels of moisture on the successful establishment of a whip and tongue graft union?

**Methodology:** Forty whip and tongue grafts will be constructed using *Prunus domestica* (plum) rootstock and scion wood.  The grafts will be divided into four groups of ten, each receiving a different level of moisture at the graft site –  completely dry, lightly misted (twice daily), moderately dampened (with a spray bottle), and saturated (with a small amount of water). Each group will be housed in separate, controlled environmental chambers to minimize extraneous variables.  The grafts will be assessed weekly for signs of vascular connection – specifically, the appearance of green tissue and the reduction of callus. Measurements of the callus diameter will be recorded.  The experiment will run for six weeks, and the data will be analyzed using ANOVA to determine if there’s a significant impact of moisture levels on graft success.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that moderate dampness will promote the fastest vascular connection.  Excessive moisture will likely inhibit callus formation and potentially lead to rot and graft failure. A lack of moisture will also likely lead to graft failure.  The results will demonstrate that maintaining appropriate moisture levels is crucial for successful whip and tongue graft development.

## Research Question 3: How can we accurately measure the diameter of callus tissue formed at a graft union?

**Methodology:**  A series of ten whip and tongue grafts on *Rosa* (rose) rootstock will be created. Each graft will be photographed immediately following creation using a digital caliper ruler.  The images will be processed to create scale bars and measurements will be taken using image analysis software (e.g., ImageJ). Measurements will be taken from multiple locations on each graft. These measurements will then be statistically analyzed to determine the reliability of visual estimation as a measurement technique. We will compare the measurements with those obtained using digital calipers.

**Expected Outcomes:** This investigation will establish a standardized method for quantifying callus tissue diameter. We anticipate that using a digital caliper will provide the most accurate and repeatable measurements.  The results will demonstrate the importance of precise measurement techniques in grafting research and provide a protocol for assessing graft success.
