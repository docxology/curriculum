## Research Question 1: How does the application of varying string tension during bridge grafting influence the rate of vascular connection formation between the scion and rootstock?

**Methodology:** This investigation will utilize a controlled experiment involving 30 grafted raspberry cuttings. The cuttings will be divided into three groups (n=10 per group). Group 1 (Control) will receive standard bridge grafting with binding string applied with moderate pressure. Group 2 will receive grafting with binding string applied at a lower tension (approximately 50% of the control). Group 3 will receive grafting with string applied at a higher tension (approximately 150% of the control). Vascular connection formation will be assessed daily for 14 days using a non-invasive optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging technique. OCT images will be analyzed to quantify the area and thickness of vascular tissue bridging the graft union. Data will be statistically analyzed using ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests to determine significant differences.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that moderate string tension (Control Group) will result in the fastest vascular connection formation, followed by the lower tension group. The highest tension group is predicted to exhibit a significantly delayed or incomplete vascular connection due to excessive pressure impeding tissue growth and vascular development.  This investigation will provide quantitative data on the optimal string tension for bridging graft union formation, contributing to best practice for bridge grafting techniques.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of bark texture compatibility between the scion and rootstock on the success rate of bridge grafts?

**Methodology:**  This study will employ a comparative analysis of 40 apple cuttings grafted onto different pear rootstocks with varying bark textures. The rootstocks will be categorized into three groups:  (1) High Bark Texture Similarity (e.g., apple onto apple); (2) Medium Bark Texture Difference (e.g., apple onto quince); and (3) High Bark Texture Difference (e.g., apple onto wild cherry).  Grafts will be conducted using standard bridge grafting techniques. Success rate (defined as a healthy, vascularly connected graft union after 21 days) will be recorded for each graft.  Visual assessment of bark contact, tissue compression, and signs of graft rejection (e.g., callus formation, discoloration) will be documented. Data will be recorded as a percentage of successful grafts for each combination.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that grafts involving similar bark textures will exhibit a significantly higher success rate than those involving dissimilar bark textures. This is because similar textures will facilitate optimal initial contact and minimize tissue resistance, promoting vascular connection. The study will quantify the relationship between bark texture similarity and graft success, illuminating a critical factor in optimizing bridge grafting.

## Research Question 3: How can we accurately measure the degree of vascular integration at the graft union using non-destructive imaging techniques?

**Methodology:** This investigation will focus on validating the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a quantitative measurement tool for assessing vascular integration. Forty bridge grafted apple cuttings will be utilized.  OCT scans will be performed daily at the graft union for 14 days. Image analysis will be conducted using specialized software that allows for the measurement of key parameters, including: (1) the area of vascular tissue bridging the graft union; (2) the average thickness of the vascular tissue; and (3) the presence and extent of any non-vascular tissue (e.g., callus).  The software's output will be compared against a standard visual assessment of the graft union by an experienced horticulturalist.  The correlation coefficient between the quantitative OCT measurements and the visual assessment will be calculated.

**Expected Outcomes:** We expect to demonstrate a strong positive correlation between the quantitative data obtained from OCT and the subjective visual assessment of the graft union. This validation will establish OCT as a reliable and reproducible technique for assessing vascular integration, providing a rapid and non-destructive method for monitoring graft success.  The study will determine the optimal resolution and scanning parameters for OCT measurements to ensure accurate quantification of vascular tissue.
