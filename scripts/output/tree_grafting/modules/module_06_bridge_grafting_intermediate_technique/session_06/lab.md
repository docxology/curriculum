# Lab 6: Bridge Grafting – Binding String

**Module:** Bridge Grafting – Intermediate Technique
**Lab Number:** 6
**Lab Focus:** Binding String

**1. Brief Background (98 words)**

This laboratory exercise focuses on the critical first step in bridge grafting – securing the scion to the rootstock. Following the principles discussed in the lecture on bridge grafting, we will utilize binding string to create the initial compression needed for cambium contact. This technique addresses the common challenge of differing growth rates between rootstock and scion by establishing a firm, controlled union. Precise application of binding string will ensure adequate pressure, directly contributing to the successful formation of a bridge, ultimately maximizing the chances of a successful graft union. Understanding the importance of this initial binding is foundational to the entire bridge grafting procedure.

**2. Lab Objectives (4 bullet points)**

*   Prepare the rootstock and scion according to lecture guidelines.
*   Secure the scion to the prepared rootstock using binding string.
*   Apply consistent and even pressure with the binding string.
*   Document all observations accurately.
*   Maintain a clean and organized work area.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   **Rootstocks:** 3 x Apple rootstocks (Malus domestica) – approximately 10-15 cm in height, with healthy bark.
*   **Scions:** 3 x Apple scions (Malus domestica) – approximately 10-15 cm in height, matching rootstock variety.
*   **Binding String:** 100 meters of waxed cotton binding string (diameter: 1mm).
*   **Utility Knife:** Sharp, single-edged utility knife (adult-sized) – 1 per group of 3 students.
*   **Sanitizing Solution:** 70% Ethanol.
*   **Paper Towels:** Lint-free.
*   **Work Surface:** Stable workbench or table.
*   **Gloves:** Nitrile gloves (3 pairs per group).

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

*   ⚠️ **Sharp Objects:** The utility knife is extremely sharp.  Exercise extreme caution during all cutting procedures. [INSTRUCTOR] – Demonstrate proper knife handling technique. Immediately report any slips or cuts.
*   ⚠️ **Biological Hazard:**  Rootstocks and scions may harbor pathogens.  Do not ingest.
*   ⚠️ **Ethanol:** 70% ethanol is flammable. Keep away from open flames.
*   ⚠️ **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** Wear nitrile gloves throughout the experiment. Goggles are required.
*   ⚠️ **Time-Sensitive Step:** Cutting the scion should be completed within 5 minutes of receiving the materials.

**5. Procedure (6 steps)**

1.  **Sanitize:** Put on nitrile gloves. Using 70% ethanol and paper towels, thoroughly clean and sanitize the cutting surface and your hands.
2.  **Prepare Rootstock:** Inspect the rootstock for any signs of disease or damage. Using the utility knife, make a clean, sloping cut on the rootstock, approximately 2 cm long and 45 degrees.  [INSTRUCTOR] – Demonstrate slope and depth.
3.  **Prepare Scion:** Make a matching sloping cut on the scion, ensuring it mirrors the rootstock cut.
4.  **Apply Binding String:** Starting at the base of the rootstock cut, wrap the binding string tightly around the rootstock, overlapping each wrap by approximately 1 cm. Continue wrapping upwards towards the scion cut.
5.  **Secure the Scion:** Wrap the binding string tightly around the scion, overlapping each wrap by approximately 1 cm. Ensure the string is snug but not overly tight – the cambium layers should be able to move slightly.
6.  **Inspect and Adjust:**  Carefully examine the graft union. Adjust the binding string as needed to maintain even pressure and secure cambium contact.

**7. Analysis Questions (5 questions)**

1.  Why is it crucial to create a sloping cut on both the rootstock and the scion?
2.  Explain the role of the binding string in establishing the graft union.
3.  What potential problems could occur if the binding string is applied too tightly?
4.  Describe the appearance of a successful cambium contact.
5.  How does bridge grafting address the issue of differing growth rates?

**8. Expected Results (Observations & Rationale)**

Students should observe a firm, secure union between the rootstock and scion. The binding string should create a consistent, compressive force, allowing for potential cambium contact. Successful cambium contact will appear as a slight blurring of the bark layers at the graft union.  The consistent pressure provided by the binding string minimizes the risk of the scion outgrowing the rootstock, aligning with the core principle of bridge grafting.
