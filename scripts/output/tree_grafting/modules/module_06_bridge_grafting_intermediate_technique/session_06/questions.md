**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Which of the following best describes the rationale behind using binding string in bridge grafting?
A) To provide structural support for the scion.
B) To create a precise mechanical fit between the rootstock and scion.
C) To establish a controlled growth differential and enhance compatibility.
D) To sterilize the grafting interface.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Binding string applies consistent pressure, moderating growth rates and maximizing cambium contact between the rootstock and scion, crucial for successful union. This addresses the growth differential problem.

**Question 3:** What is the significance of "cambium contact" in graft union?
A) It ensures complete vascular occlusion.
B) It facilitates nutrient exchange between the scion and rootstock.
C) It prevents the formation of callus tissue.
D) It determines the ultimate size of the graft union.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Cambium tissue is responsible for cell division and differentiation, enabling the vascular connections necessary for nutrient and water transport between the scion and rootstock. Proper contact is fundamental to graft success.

**Question 4:**  Considering the lecture's focus on bridge grafting, why might a direct cleft graft fail when grafting an apple onto a pear rootstock?
A) Because apple rootstocks are inherently more tolerant of differing growth rates.
B) Because apple scions always exhibit significantly faster growth than pear rootstocks.
C)  Due to the mechanical stress created by the growth differential and potential tissue incompatibility.
D)  Because the bark textures of apple and pear rootstocks are always perfectly compatible.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** A growth differential between the apple scion and pear rootstock creates stress at the graft union, often leading to failure due to incompatibility. The bridge provides a buffer to mitigate this stress.

**Question 5:**  During bridge grafting, what is the primary goal of preparing the rootstock?
A) To induce callus formation at the graft union.
B) To create a sterile grafting surface.
C) To ensure an open and receptive vascular system for cambium contact.
D) To maximize the rootstock's resistance to fungal infections.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Proper rootstock preparation – an open and receptive vascular system – is paramount for establishing cambium contact, which is necessary for nutrient exchange and graft union.

**Question 6:**  Briefly describe your observations regarding the pressure exerted by the binding string during the lab exercise?
**Answer:** I observed that consistent pressure was applied to the scion and rootstock, creating a firm, even compression. The string felt snug, and the bark appeared slightly flattened where it was secureD) This indicated adequate pressure to promote cambium contact, as demonstrated by the instructor.

**Question 7:**  How does the “bridge” in bridge grafting relate to the concept of creating a balanced growth pattern?
**Answer:** The bridge acts as a buffer, slowing down the growth of the scion relative to the rootstock. This prevents the scion from outgrowing the rootstock, effectively balancing the growth rates and ensuring a more sustainable graft union.

**Question 8:**  Imagine you are creating a bridge graft of a fast-growing raspberry variety onto a slower-growing blackberry rootstock. What potential challenges might you anticipate, beyond simply applying binding string?
**Answer:** Besides applying adequate pressure, I would anticipate issues such as differing bark textures, which can hinder initial contact, and potentially the blackberry rootstock’s lower tolerance for rapid scion growth, requiring careful monitoring and possibly supplemental support.

**Question 9:**  Explain the significance of maintaining a clean and organized work area during bridge grafting.?
**Answer:** Maintaining a clean workspace is crucial to prevent contamination, ensuring the grafting interface remains sterile and free from pathogens, which could compromise graft union success and potentially lead to disease.

**Question 10:**  Discuss how understanding the principles of bridge grafting contributes to successful horticultural practices.?
**Answer:**  Bridge grafting allows for the integration of genetically distinct plants, overcoming growth rate disparities. This technique is vital for propagation, producing hybrid varieties with desired characteristics, and adapting to diverse environmental conditions, demonstrating a crucial element in horticultural strategies.
