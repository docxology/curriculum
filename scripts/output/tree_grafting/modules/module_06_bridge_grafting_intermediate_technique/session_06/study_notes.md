## Bridge Grafting – Intermediate Technique

This lecture focuses on bridge grafting, a specialized technique offering a robust solution for challenging graft unions, particularly when dealing with differing growth rates or tissue incompatibilities between rootstock and scion. Understanding the principles behind this technique is paramount for achieving graft union success.

**Concept Name**: Cambium Contact: The critical process where the vascular cambium of the rootstock and scion align, facilitating the transfer of nutrients and water, and ultimately, the formation of a vascular union. Successful graft unions fundamentally rely on this direct contact.

**Concept Name**: Vascular Union: The physiological connection formed between the vascular tissues (cambium) of the rootstock and scion, allowing for the continuous transport of water, nutrients, and sugars – the lifeline for the newly grafted plant.

**Concept Name**: Growth Differential: The difference in growth rates between the rootstock and scion. A significant growth differential is the primary challenge bridge grafting addresses; it creates mechanical stress at the graft union, frequently leading to failure.

**Concept Name**: Rootstock Preparation: Essential for graft success. The rootstock’s vascular system must be open and receptive to the scion. This involves carefully preparing the rootstock stem – often by making a long, shallow cut to expose the cambium layer.

**Concept Name**: Bridge Layer: A supplemental layer of tissue introduced during bridge grafting to moderate growth and enhance compatibility. This ‘bridge’ essentially acts as a buffer between the rootstock and scion, minimizing the effects of the growth differential.

**Concept Name**: Bark Texture Compatibility: Bridge grafting is particularly effective when the rootstock and scion have significantly different bark textures.  This difference can hinder direct contact, and the bridge layer provides a way to overcome this barrier.

**Concept Name**: Mechanical Stress at the Union: The force exerted on the graft union due to differing growth rates. The bridge layer significantly reduces this mechanical stress, improving the chances of a successful union.

**Concept Name**: Scion Selection for Bridge Grafting: When selecting a scion, prioritize varieties that possess moderate growth rates or those that can be selected for slower growth through pruning techniques. This aligns with the core principle of the bridge grafting technique.

**Additional Points & Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Bridge grafting is often performed during periods of active growth for both the rootstock and scion.
*   **Cleanliness:** Maintaining a clean graft site is crucial to prevent infection and ensure optimal tissue contact.
*   **Secure Binding:**  Proper binding of the string is critical for maintaining pressure and promoting union.
