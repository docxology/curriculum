## Course Description

A focused introduction to Active Inference principles and their applications in contemporary AI systems. 
This course provides an intuitive understanding of how Active Inference—the principle that adaptive systems 
minimize variational free energy through perception, action, and learning—relates to and enhances modern 
generative AI architectures. Students will explore how variational inference, predictive coding, and Bayesian 
model selection connect to transformer architectures, large language models, and diffusion models. The course 
examines how Active Inference principles inform key challenges in 2025's AI landscape: alignment (ensuring AI 
systems pursue intended goals through proper generative models and precision weighting), multiagent coordination 
(how multiple AI agents achieve shared inference through free energy minimization), spatial intelligence 
(embodied AI that grounds language and vision in actionable world models), and emerging applications in 
autonomous systems, human-AI collaboration, and adaptive interfaces. Students will understand how free energy 
minimization provides a principled framework for building AI systems that actively gather information, update 
beliefs under uncertainty, and select actions that resolve ambiguity—capabilities essential for robust, 
interpretable, and aligned AI. The course connects theoretical principles to practical implementations, showing 
how concepts like prediction error minimization, precision-weighted inference, and active sampling manifest in 
contemporary AI architectures and inform design choices for next-generation systems.


## Additional Constraints

Focus on intuitive understanding over mathematical derivation. Emphasize connections between Active Inference 
principles and familiar AI concepts (attention mechanisms, RLHF, exploration-exploitation, model-based RL). 
Include concrete examples from current AI systems (LLMs, multimodal models, robotics). Address practical 
implications for AI development, deployment, and alignment. Connect each theoretical principle to real-world 
applications in 2025's AI landscape. Suitable for AI practitioners, researchers, and developers seeking 
principled frameworks for understanding and building adaptive AI systems.
