**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Which of the following best describes the concept of Bayesian inference?
A) A purely deterministic approach to prediction.
B) A statistical method that updates beliefs based on new evidence.
C) A mathematical model solely reliant on observed data.
D) A process that ignores prior knowledge.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Bayesian inference uses prior beliefs and updated evidence to calculate probabilities of future events. It’s a probabilistic framework where new data refines our understanding, unlike purely deterministic models.

**Question 3:**  How does predictive coding relate to perception-action loops?
A) Perception always precedes action, providing a stable model of the world.
B) Action is a passive response to sensory input, without influencing the model.
C) Action actively shapes our perceptual experience by reducing surprise.
D) The brain solely relies on sensory input to construct a fixed, unchanging model.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Active Inference proposes that action isn’t just a response to sensation, but actively shapes perception by minimizing ‘surprise’ – continually adjusting the model to align with experience.

**Question 4:** What is variational free energy (VFE) designed to measure?
A) The accuracy of a predictive model.
B) The difference between a predicted model and observed sensory data.
C) The complexity of a neural network architecture.
D) The rate of neuronal firing.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** VFE quantifies the 'surprise' – the mismatch – between a brain’s model of the world and the sensory information it receives. This provides a key metric for action selection.

**Question 5:**  Why is minimizing surprise a central goal in Active Inference?
A) It ensures perfect replication of the external world.
B) It represents the brain’s drive to reduce uncertainty and predictively shape experience.
C) It solely focuses on reaction time optimization.
D) It guarantees complete information processing.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The principle of minimizing surprise reflects the brain’s fundamental drive to build accurate predictive models of the world, driving adaptive behavior.

**Question 6:**  Describe the role of the nervous system in a perception-action loop.?
**Answer:** The nervous system facilitates continuous communication between the sensory systems and motor systems. Sensory information is relayed to the brain, where it's compared to an internal model. If a mismatch is detected (high ‘surprise’), the brain generates a motor command to reduce this mismatch, directly influencing the environment and, consequently, sensory input.

**Question 7:**  Explain how a participant’s reported perception of a moving dot could be used to illustrate free energy minimization.?
**Answer:**  If a participant consistently reports the dot appearing in a specific location, it suggests the brain’s predictive model accurately reflects that location. Conversely, if the participant’s reports shift dramatically as the dot moves, it indicates the model is inaccurate, and action – such as eye movements – is being employed to reduce the ‘surprise’ associated with the unexpected movement.

**Question 8:**  Considering the cup-reaching example, how does Active Inference differ from a purely passive view of human behavior?
**Answer:** The Active Inference perspective suggests that reaching for a cup isn't simply a response to seeing it; the brain is *actively* predicting where the cup will be and takes action to bring it closer, continually refining its model of the environment and the object's movement.  This contrasts with a passive view where the brain just reacts.

**Question 9:**  How might understanding variational free energy help us develop more adaptive robots?
**Answer:** By enabling robots to continuously minimize the difference between their internal models and the sensory data they receive, we can design systems that can react more effectively to novel and unpredictable environments, much like the human brain. This would allow for more flexible and robust behavior.

**Question 10:**  Synthesize the roles of predictive coding and Bayesian inference in creating adaptive behavior.?
**Answer:** Both concepts are intertwineD) Predictive coding uses Bayesian inference to constantly update its internal model of the world.  The model predicts sensory input, and Bayesian inference then adjusts those predictions based on new sensory evidence, allowing the system to minimize surprise and, ultimately, generate adaptive behaviors that are both flexible and robust.
