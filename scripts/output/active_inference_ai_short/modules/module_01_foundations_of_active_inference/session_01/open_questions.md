## Open Question 1: What is the role of predictive coding in mediating the effects of sensory illusions?

Context: Sensory illusions, such as the Müller-Lyer illusion, demonstrate how our perception can deviate significantly from objective reality. Recent research utilizing computational models of predictive coding suggests that these illusions aren’t simply errors in processing, but rather reflect the brain’s active construction of perceptual experience. The brain constantly generates predictive models of the world, and inconsistencies between these models and incoming sensory data trigger perceptual distortions. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which predictive coding contributes to illusions offers crucial insights into the flexible and sometimes unreliable nature of human perception. Current research: Computational neuroscience, cognitive psychology, Bayesian modeling.

## Open Question 2: How does the integration of prior experience influence the generation of internally consistent perceptual representations in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?

Context: Individuals with ASD often exhibit atypical perceptual experiences, including difficulties with sensory processing and social perception. Theories of predictive coding propose that perceptual processes rely on building and maintaining internal models of the world.  However, the way these models are constructed and maintained can differ significantly in individuals with ASD. Research investigates whether differences in the way prior experiences shape these internal models – specifically relating to social and sensory information – contribute to the distinct perceptual profiles observed in this population. Current research: Developmental psychology, computational neuroscience, clinical psychology, Bayesian modeling.

## Open Question 3: What are the implications of exploring feedback loops in the visual system for designing assistive technologies for visually impaired individuals?

Context: The concept of predictive coding highlights the dynamic, feedback-driven nature of visual processing.  If our perception isn’t solely a passive reception of sensory data, but an active construction based on internal predictions and error signals, then this understanding can dramatically inform the design of assistive technologies.  Specifically, understanding how the visual system continuously updates its model based on sensory feedback could lead to more robust and adaptive systems for guiding individuals with visual impairments, offering greater precision and responsiveness to complex environmental cues. Current research: Biopsychophysics, assistive technology, robotics, computational neuroscience, Bayesian modeling.
