Okay, here’s the formatted research question set, incorporating all the requirements and feedback. This delivers the content in the precise format requested, ready for direct use.

## Research Question 1: How does the predictability of a moving stimulus affect the speed of motor adaptation?

**Methodology:** This investigation will employ a visual-motor adaptation paradigm. Participants will be presented with a moving visual stimulus (e.g., a white square moving horizontally across a grey background) at a varying speed.  Initially, the stimulus speed will be relatively slow.  After a brief adaptation period (approximately 30 seconds), the speed will suddenly increase to a higher, unexpected level. The participant's task is to maintain accurate visual tracking of the stimulus as it moves.  We'll measure the time taken for the participant to accurately track the stimulus at the new, faster speed – this is the ‘adaptation time’.  We’ll repeat this process with different stimulus speeds and a sufficient number of trials (e.g., 20 per speed) to ensure reliable data. Control conditions will include a stationary stimulus and a sudden decrease in stimulus speed.  We’ll record eye-tracking data (fixation points, saccade frequency) to supplement the reaction time measurements.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that participants will exhibit a faster adaptation time when the stimulus speed increases abruptly compared to a gradual increase or a stationary stimulus. This will demonstrate that the brain is actively forming and updating its predictive model in response to the unexpected change, requiring a quicker adjustment of motor commands. We expect to see a correlation between the change in stimulus speed and the adaptation time. The eye-tracking data should show increased saccade frequency during the adaptation phase, reflecting the brain’s effort to visually ‘catch up’ with the changing stimulus.  This confirms Active Inference principles.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of prior experience with similar moving stimuli on the perceptual accuracy of object tracking?

**Methodology:**  Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: a ‘high experience’ group (previously exposed to a series of similar moving stimuli), a ‘low experience’ group (exposed to a limited number of moving stimuli), and a ‘control’ group (exposed to a stationary stimulus).  All participants will then be presented with a novel moving stimulus (e.g., a rotating square). Their task is to accurately estimate the square’s rotation rate. We’ll measure this estimation rate via a visual analogue scale (VAS) where participants mark their estimate on a scale from 0 to 100 degrees per second. The experience groups will receive 10 training trials beforehand with similar stimuli before the actual measurement trials commence.  This allows us to assess how previous exposure influences the speed and accuracy of perceptual learning.  We’ll control for potential confounding factors such as stimulus size and background contrast.

**Expected Outcomes:**  We anticipate that the ‘high experience’ group will exhibit a faster learning curve – i.e., a quicker and more accurate estimate of the stimulus rotation rate – compared to the ‘low experience’ and ‘control’ groups.  This illustrates the brain's ability to leverage prior experience to efficiently build and refine its predictive model, resulting in a more accurate perception of change.  We expect the control group’s response to be significantly slower and less precise than the other two groups.  This data will further demonstrate the core concept of Active Inference.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the precision of the internal model representation of a moving object?

**Methodology:** Participants will be presented with a complex, moving object (e.g., a rotating 3D shape) with varying levels of complexity (e.g., changing its rotation speed and trajectory). Participants will perform a ‘tracking’ task where they must visually estimate the object’s position and orientation.  We'll use a combination of subjective ratings (e.g., on a Likert scale of 'confidence' in their estimate) and objective metrics like RMS (Root Mean Square) error between their estimated location and the true location of the object.  The RMS error provides a quantitative measure of the discrepancies between the model and reality. Further, we’ll perform a ‘surprise’ rating - asking participants to subjectively rate how much the visual information "surprised" them, as a proxy for model inaccuracy.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that higher RMS error scores and higher ‘surprise’ ratings will correspond to a less accurate internal model representation of the object’s movement.  We anticipate that participants will be able to accurately perceive and track the object when its movement is consistent and predictable, and will struggle more when the movement is erratic or unpredictable. This investigation will validate the Active Inference framework by demonstrating how the brain dynamically updates its model based on incoming sensory data, reflecting the constant effort to minimize surprise.
