## Foundations of Active Inference

**Introduction**

Welcome to Foundations of Active Inference. In this module, we’ll explore a radical yet increasingly compelling framework for understanding how adaptive systems – from humans and animals to robots – interact with and shape their environment. Traditionally, neuroscience and psychology have often treated perception and action as separate processes, with perception passively receiving information from the world and action responding to that information. Active Inference challenges this dichotomy, proposing that perception and action are fundamentally intertwined, driven by a unified goal: minimizing surprise. This lecture will lay the groundwork for understanding this concept, introducing core principles and establishing a theoretical foundation. We’ll begin by considering how our brains actively construct models of the world, not simply reacting to it. Consider the simple act of reaching for a cup of coffee. A passive view would see your brain simply registering the visual information about the cup’s location and then initiating a motor command to move your arm. Active Inference suggests a different story—that your brain is constantly predicting where the cup *will be* and taking action to bring it closer to your hand, reducing the uncertainty associated with that prediction.
