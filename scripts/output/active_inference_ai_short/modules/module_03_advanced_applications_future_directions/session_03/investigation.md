Okay, here’s a series of three research questions formatted according to your specifications, along with the requested methodologies and expected outcomes. I’ve aimed for approximately 150-200 words per question.

## Research Question 1: How does varying the level of shared contextual information within a multi-agent system impact the speed and accuracy of collaborative task completion?

**Methodology:** This research will utilize a simulated multi-agent environment (e.g., a warehouse navigation scenario).  We will create three distinct system configurations: 1) “Minimal Context” – agents operate with only individual sensor data and basic location information. 2) “Moderate Context” – agents share limited contextual information about nearby obstacles and target locations. 3) “Full Context” – agents share comprehensive, real-time data about the environment, including obstacle positions, target locations, and predicted movements of other agents.  Each configuration will be tested with a standardized set of tasks – navigating to specific locations, retrieving objects, and delivering them to designated points. We will measure task completion time and error rates (e.g., collisions, incorrect deliveries) for each configuration, running each setup 50 times to ensure statistical significance.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that the “Full Context” configuration will demonstrate the fastest task completion times and lowest error rates, as shared information allows for proactive planning and coordination. We expect the “Moderate Context” group to fall somewhere in between.  The “Minimal Context” group will likely struggle, exhibiting slower times and higher error rates due to reactive behavior.  Data analysis will reveal the optimal level of shared context for maximizing collaboration efficiency.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of introducing noise into sensor data on the performance of a distributed collaborative mapping system?

**Methodology:** This investigation will simulate a team of robots tasked with collaboratively building a map of an unknown environment. The robots’ sensors will generate simulated data, and we will systematically introduce varying degrees of “noise” – random fluctuations – into this data. Noise levels will range from “Low” (minimal disruption) to “High” (significant distortion).  We will use a system based on Bayesian inference, where robots update their understanding of the environment based on the incoming sensor data, weighted by their confidence levels. The system’s ability to accurately represent the environment will be measured by comparing the generated map with a ground truth map (created by a perfect sensor).  The success metric will be Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in measuring the discrepancies. This will be repeated 30 times per level.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that as noise levels increase, the accuracy of the collaborative map will degrade. While the system’s inherent robustness may allow it to partially compensate, the RMSE will steadily rise, demonstrating the detrimental impact of sensor inaccuracies on collaborative mapping.  We expect a non-linear relationship – a small increase in noise might have a negligible effect, while a large increase will result in a significant decline in map quality. The data analysis will inform strategies for mitigating the effects of sensor noise, such as data filtering or confidence weighting.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the efficiency of a decentralized decision-making protocol for resource allocation in a multi-agent system?

**Methodology:** This research will simulate a scenario where a group of robots must collaboratively allocate limited resources (e.g., energy, tools) to complete tasks. We will implement a decentralized decision-making protocol based on a voting system, where each robot independently proposes a resource allocation strategy.  The system will track several metrics to evaluate efficiency, including: the total number of tasks completed, the average time taken to complete a task, and the amount of wasted resources.  We’ll use a simulation with 10 robots, varying the complexity of the tasks and the agents’ autonomy levels. We will assess performance over 100 iterations, recording the average efficiency score (calculated from task completion time and resource utilization).

**Expected Outcomes:**  We hypothesize that a higher level of communication and information sharing amongst the robots will improve efficiency. A system utilizing a more structured voting process or weighted voting system will exhibit improved efficiency compared to a simple, uncoordinated voting process.  The data will demonstrate that the decentralized voting protocol's success depends on factors like agent cooperation and information exchange. The results will quantify the relationship between these factors and the overall system performance.
