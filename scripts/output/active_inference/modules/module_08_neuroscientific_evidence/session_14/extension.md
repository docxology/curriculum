## Topic 1: Multi-Scale Predictive Coding and Oscillatory Dynamics

Recent research strongly suggests that predictive coding isn't a static process confined to individual cortical areas. Instead, it operates across multiple spatial and temporal scales, intricately linked by oscillatory dynamics. Current investigations focus on the role of synchronized neural oscillations – particularly in the theta and gamma frequency bands – as a key mechanism driving this multi-scale prediction. Specifically, theta oscillations are hypothesized to mediate communication between distant cortical areas, while gamma oscillations are thought to represent the local precision of predictive signals.  Emerging evidence indicates that disruptions in these oscillatory patterns, often observed in neurological disorders like schizophrenia and autism, directly impair the accuracy of predictive coding.  Furthermore, the integration of sensory information relies heavily on the precise timing of these oscillations; even slight delays can lead to significant perceptual distortions.  Future research will likely examine how feedback loops between different oscillatory bands contribute to hierarchical predictive processing, exploring how precise timing impacts the robustness and efficiency of the system. Studying the influence of specific brain regions on this orchestration is a critical area of focus.

## Topic 2:  Bayesian Predictive Coding and Uncertainty Quantification

Bayesian predictive coding provides a powerful framework for understanding how the brain deals with uncertainty. Moving beyond traditional feedforward models, this approach explicitly incorporates prior knowledge and estimates the degree of uncertainty associated with predictions. The core concept is that each cortical area generates a prediction based on its internal model, but also estimates the uncertainty surrounding that prediction. This uncertainty is then passed back to higher-level areas, allowing for adjustments to the prior model. Research increasingly highlights the critical role of error signals, which aren’t just about the difference between prediction and sensory input, but rather encode *information* about the uncertainty. Studies utilizing dynamic causal modeling have demonstrated that feedback pathways are modulated by these uncertainty estimates, strengthening connections related to more reliable predictions and weakening those for ambiguous sensory information. Recent advancements explore how internal models can learn and adapt, constantly refining predictions in the face of noise. Investigating the neural correlates of this learning process, particularly within the prefrontal cortex, offers significant insights into the mechanisms underlying adaptation and cognitive flexibility.

## Topic 3:  Predictive Coding and the Default Mode Network

The Default Mode Network (DMN), characterized by activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and angular gyrus, has long been implicated in internal thought, self-referential processing, and episodic memory. However, recent theories propose that the DMN plays a fundamental role in predictive coding, acting as a ‘prior’ system that generates expectations about the environment. This ‘prior’ is then continuously updated based on sensory input. Importantly, research suggests that disruptions to the DMN—often observed in conditions like depression—can impair this predictive coding function, leading to over-reliance on internal biases and difficulties integrating external experiences. Advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI and EEG, are now being used to examine the dynamic interplay between the DMN and other cortical networks during tasks requiring predictive processing. Investigations are also exploring how the DMN contributes to generating internal models of self and others—effectively, creating predictions about our own and others' behavior. Furthermore, the role of the DMN in generating top-down predictions and modulating sensory processing based on prior knowledge is a key area of ongoing investigation.
