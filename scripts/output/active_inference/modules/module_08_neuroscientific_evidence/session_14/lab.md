**Lab Focus: Predictive Coding**

**1. Brief Background (98 words)**

This laboratory exercise explores the principles of predictive coding, building upon our discussion of cortical representations and neural networks.  The brain doesn’t simply record sensory input; instead, it actively constructs our perception by predicting what it expects to receive and comparing this prediction to the actual sensory data. This process generates prediction errors, which are then used to refine these predictions and shape our conscious experience. We will utilize a visual stimulus – a simple image – to illustrate this concept, mimicking how neurons in the visual cortex process information and generate prediction errors. The experiment aims to demonstrate that perception is an active, rather than passive, process.

**2. Lab Objectives (4 bullet points)**

*   Identify differences in neural responses to a visual stimulus before and after it is presented.
*   Record changes in a subjective perception scale for the presented stimulus.
*   Construct a simple model of predictive coding by adjusting stimulus presentation timing.
*   Analyze data to determine how prediction errors influence perceptual responses.
*   Relate observations to the concept of active sensory processing.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   **Computer:**  Running a dedicated experimental software program (e.g., PsychoPy, MATLAB with Psychophysics Toolbox) – [INSTRUCTOR] will provide the software.
*   **Monitor:**  Calibrated 24-inch monitor.
*   **Mouse/Keyboard:** For control input.
*   **Stimuli:** High-resolution image of a simple geometric shape (e.g., a square) – 100px x 100px.  [INSTRUCTOR] will prepare the stimulus files.
*   **Experimental Software:** PsychoPy or equivalent.
*   **Data Logger:** Software integrated into the experimental program.
*   **Calibration Cards:** Grayscale calibration cards for monitor calibration.
*   **Ruler:** For measuring perceptual responses.

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

*   **Eye Strain:** Take frequent breaks (every 20 minutes) and follow the 20-20-20 rule (every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds).
*   **Electrical Safety:** Ensure all cables are in good condition and not frayed. Do not operate equipment near water. [INSTRUCTOR] will demonstrate safe operating procedures.
*   **Monitor Overheating:** Monitor viewing time and ensure adequate ventilation in the lab.  [INSTRUCTOR] will monitor lab temperature.
*   **Computer Hygiene:**  Maintain a clean workstation to prevent accidental damage to equipment.

**5. Procedure (7 steps)**

1.  **Calibration:** Using the calibration cards, calibrate the monitor brightness and contrast to a neutral gray (level 70 on a 0-100 scale).  Record the brightness setting. [INSTRUCTOR] will guide the calibration process.
2.  **Baseline Measurement:**  Present the square stimulus for 500ms.  Record the participant’s subjective rating of the stimulus intensity on a scale of 1 (no sensation) to 10 (maximum sensation) in the data logger.
3.  **Predictive Phase:**  Present the square stimulus for 500ms, followed by a 500ms blank screen.  Record the subjective rating.
4.  **Delay Phase:**  Introduce a 1-second delay before presenting the square stimulus again. Present the stimulus for 500ms. Record the subjective rating.
5.  **Repeat:**  Repeat steps 3-4 for a total of 10 trials.
6.  **Data Recording:** The experimental software automatically logs stimulus presentation timing and the participant’s subjective ratings for each trial.
7.  **Clean-up:**  Power down the computer and gather all materials.

**7. Analysis Questions (5 questions)**

1.  How did the subjective ratings change between the predictive phase and the delay phase? Explain this in terms of the brain’s predictive coding framework.
2.  Why might the subjective rating be higher during the predictive phase compared to the delay phase?
3.  What role do you think prediction errors play in shaping our perception of the stimulus?
4.  If the delay between stimuli were increased, how might this affect the subjective ratings?
5.  Relate the results of this experiment to how the brain might actively construct its representations of the visual world.

**8. Expected Results (2 paragraphs)**

Students are expected to observe a higher subjective rating during the predictive phase, reflecting the brain's expectation of the stimulus. The delay phase will show a decreased rating, suggesting a prediction error occurred because the stimulus didn’t match the initial expectation. The data will illustrate that the brain doesn't simply record sensory input; instead, it actively constructs our perception by predicting what it expects to receive and then comparing that prediction to the actual sensory data.  Variations in individual ratings will be expected, further demonstrating the active nature of perception.
