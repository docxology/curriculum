**Question 1:** Which of the following best describes the function of a sensory receptor?
A) To transmit signals over long distances in the nervous system?
B) To convert external stimuli into electrical signals that the brain can interpret?
C) To synthesize neurotransmitters for synaptic transmission?
D) To maintain homeostasis within the body?
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Sensory receptors are specialized cells that detect specific stimuli – light, sound, touch, temperature – and transform them into neural signals, initiating the perceptual process. This transduction is crucial for our ability to sense and respond to the environment.

**Question 2:** What is the primary role of ribosomes in a cell?
A) Digesting cellular waste products
B) Synthesizing proteins
C) Storing genetic information
D) Regulating cellular metabolism
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis, translating mRNA sequences into polypeptide chains, which are then folded into functional proteins essential for cellular processes. This process is fundamental to cell structure and function.

**Question 3:**  Predictive coding suggests that the brain primarily operates by?
A) Passively recording sensory input without interpretation?
B) Actively constructing our perception by comparing predictions to reality?
C) Relying solely on bottom-up processing from sensory organs?
D) Generating random neural activity to create novel experiences?
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The theory posits the brain doesn’t just record sensations; instead, it continually predicts incoming stimuli, comparing these predictions to actual sensory data, leading to prediction errors that refine perceptions.

**Question 4:**  What is the significance of the “action potential” in neuronal communication?
A) It represents a long-lasting change in membrane potential?
B) It is a graded potential that diminishes over distance?
C) It is a brief, all-or-none electrical signal transmitted along a neuron?
D) It is a chemical signal released at the synapse?
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The action potential is a rapid, transient change in membrane potential that travels down a neuron's axon, allowing for fast, long-distance communication within the nervous system.

**Question 5:**  Considering the lab exercise, how would changes in the subjective perception scale relate to the concept of predictive coding?
A) Larger changes in the scale would indicate a complete lack of predictive accuracy?
B) Smaller changes in the scale would suggest the brain was perfectly predicting the stimulus?
C) Larger changes in the scale would demonstrate the brain’s ability to refine its predictions based on prediction errors?
D) The scale would remain constant regardless of the stimulus presentation?
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** This reflects the core principle of predictive coding: discrepancies between predicted and actual stimuli generate prediction errors, driving adjustments in subsequent predictions and ultimately shaping our perception.

**Question 6:**  Briefly describe the key difference between a motor neuron and a sensory neuron?
**Answer:** Sensory neurons transmit information *from* sensory receptors *to* the central nervous system, carrying information about the external environment. Motor neurons, conversely, transmit signals *from* the central nervous system *to* muscles and glands, initiating movement or glandular responses. Key points include the direction of signal transmission and the resulting effect.

**Question 7:**  Explain how the lab exercise utilizes the principles of predictive coding to demonstrate perceptual changes?
**Answer:** The experiment demonstrates predictive coding by presenting a simple stimulus (e.g., a square) and monitoring changes in the subjective perception scale. When the stimulus appears, the brain initially predicts its presence. Any deviation between the predicted and actual appearance of the stimulus generates a prediction error, which then modifies the subsequent perceptual response, illustrating the brain's active role in constructing experience.

**Question 8:**  Discuss a potential real-world application of understanding predictive coding in the field of prosthetics?
**Answer:** Predictive coding could be used to design more intuitive and responsive prosthetic limbs. By understanding how the brain predicts movement and anticipates sensory feedback, designers could create prosthetics that proactively compensate for anticipated movements, reducing the user’s cognitive load and enhancing control – mimicking natural neural processes.

**Question 9:**  How does the concept of "neural populations" contribute to our understanding of cortical representations?
**Answer:** Neural populations represent distinct groups of interconnected neurons within the cortex that collectively encode specific features or aspects of sensory input. Rather than a single neuron representing a complete visual object, multiple populations collaborate to build a rich, multi-faceted representation of the visual world.

**Question 10:**  Summarize how the concept of "prediction errors" fuels learning within the framework of predictive coding?
**Answer:**  Prediction errors, arising from the comparison between predicted and actual sensory input, trigger adjustments in neural networks. These changes refine future predictions, strengthening connections associated with accurate predictions and weakening those associated with inaccurate ones, ultimately driving learning and adaptation.
