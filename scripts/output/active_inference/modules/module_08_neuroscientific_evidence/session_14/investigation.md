Okay, let’s craft the research questions and their detailed specifications, strictly adhering to the provided format and requirements.

## Research Question 1: How does visual attention influence the perceived brightness of a static image?

**Methodology:**  This investigation will employ a within-subjects design. Participants (N=30, undergraduate psychology students) will be presented with a series of static images (e.g., a gray square) varying in brightness levels. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) Baseline – viewing the static image for 30 seconds without any manipulation; (2) Attended – viewing the same static image, with a small arrow briefly appearing in a specific location on the screen, requiring the participant to briefly focus on that point; and (3) Control – viewing a different, equally bright static image.  After each presentation, participants will rate the perceived brightness of the image on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = very dark, 7 = very bright).  Reaction time to the arrow appearance (in the Attended condition) will also be recorded.  Data will be analyzed using ANOVA to determine if there are significant differences in brightness ratings and reaction times between the three conditions.  Eye-tracking data (if available, as an extension) would provide valuable insights into visual fixations.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that participants in the “Attended” condition will rate the image as significantly brighter than those in the “Baseline” and “Control” conditions.  Furthermore, we anticipate that reaction times in the “Attended” condition will be significantly shorter, indicating a focused visual search. This would support the predictive coding model, where attentional focus actively modulates the perceived brightness of the visual input, refining the brain’s internal representation of the world. We also expect potential variations due to individual differences in attentional control.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of auditory masking on the accuracy of a simple visual discrimination task?

**Methodology:** This experiment will use a between-subjects design. Participants (N=45, undergraduate psychology students) will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) Masking – Participants will perform a simple visual discrimination task (e.g., identifying whether a small circle is above or below a line) while simultaneously listening to a white noise tone at a moderate level; (2) Control – Participants will perform the same visual discrimination task in silence. The visual discrimination task will require participants to correctly identify shapes or colors. Accuracy (percentage of correct responses) and reaction time will be recorded. Data will be analyzed using independent samples t-tests to compare performance between the two conditions.  Participants will complete a short questionnaire assessing their subjective experience of auditory distraction.

**Expected Outcomes:** We predict that participants in the “Masking” condition will exhibit significantly lower accuracy compared to the “Control” condition. Furthermore, we anticipate that reaction times will be slower in the masking condition, indicating an increased cognitive load.  The subjective questionnaire findings may reveal that participants in the masking condition experience greater levels of auditory distraction and difficulty with the visual task. This outcome would align with predictive coding—that auditory masking disrupts the sensory input stream, impacting the brain’s ability to accurately build a representation of the visual stimulus.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the influence of context on the perceived emotional valence of a brief auditory stimulus?

**Methodology:**  This study will utilize a within-subjects design. Participants (N=24, undergraduate psychology students) will be presented with short auditory stimuli (e.g., brief musical snippets) categorized as either "positive" (e.g., upbeat music) or “negative” (e.g., dissonant chords).  Before each presentation, participants will complete a short mood questionnaire (e.g., PANAS) to establish their baseline emotional state.  Immediately after each stimulus, participants will rate the perceived valence (positive or negative) of the sound on a 7-point Likert scale.  Physiological data (e.g., heart rate variability, skin conductance response) will also be recorded. Data will be analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA to assess the interaction between stimulus type and individual differences in baseline mood.

**Expected Outcomes:**  We anticipate that participants will rate the “positive” stimuli as significantly more positive and the “negative” stimuli as significantly more negative compared to baseline.  Furthermore, we predict that individuals with a more positive baseline mood will exhibit a greater difference in their ratings of the stimuli, reflecting an enhanced sensitivity to emotional cues.  The physiological data may reveal an increased physiological response (e.g., higher heart rate variability) in individuals responding more strongly to the negative stimuli, indicating greater emotional arousal. This investigation would demonstrate how predictive coding incorporates contextual influences—that prior emotional states shape the interpretation of sensory information.
