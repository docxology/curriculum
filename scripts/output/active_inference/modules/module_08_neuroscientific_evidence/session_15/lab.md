**Lab Focus: Internal Models of Movement**

**1. Brief Background (98 words)**

Following our lecture on motor control, this lab investigates the concept of Internal Models of Movement. We will explore how the brain actively constructs predictions about movement and uses error signals to refine these predictions. Participants will perform a simple reaching task, deliberately introducing perturbations to simulate the brain’s corrective mechanisms. By analyzing participant movement data, students will gain a practical understanding of how the brain anticipates movement and adjusts its internal model to achieve desired outcomes – mirroring the bicycle-riding example discussed in the lecture. This hands-on exercise bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and the dynamic nature of motor control.

**2. Lab Objectives (4 bullet points)**

*   Predict movement trajectories during a reaching task with varying levels of perturbation.
*   Identify and quantify the influence of error signals on movement adjustments.
*   Compare movement data across different perturbation levels.
*   Analyze the relationship between internal model accuracy and movement performance.
*   Evaluate the impact of anticipatory control on movement smoothness.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   **Participant:** 1 (seated)
*   **Target:** Adjustable visual target (e.g., laser pointer on a wall, digital display - 10cm radius)
*   **Reaching Tool:** Standard adjustable ruler (30 cm length, 1 cm markings)
*   **Force Plate:** Small, portable force plate (capable of measuring vertical acceleration, resolution: 0.1 g)
*   **Data Acquisition System:** Computer with data logging software compatible with the force plate. [INSTRUCTOR: Software: “Motion Capture Pro v3”]
*   **Calibration Tools:** Calibration cards (white A4 paper, black square 5cm x 5cm)
*   **Visual Display:** Monitor for data visualization.
*   **Stopwatch:** Digital stopwatch.

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

⚠️ **Physical Hazard:** Risk of minor tripping or falls. Ensure the testing area is clear of obstructions and has a non-slip floor surface.
⚠️ **Equipment Hazard:** The force plate is sensitive to vibrations. Maintain a stable testing environment. Avoid sudden movements during data collection.
⚠️ **Equipment Malfunction:** If the data acquisition system malfunctions, immediately stop the experiment and contact [INSTRUCTOR] for assistance.
⚠️ **PPE Requirements:** Safety glasses (ANSI Z87.1 rated) must be worn at all times. Comfortable, closed-toe shoes are required.

**5. Procedure (7 steps)**

1.  **Setup:** Position the participant seated 1 meter from the target. Ensure the force plate is placed directly beneath the participant’s dominant hand.
2.  **Calibration:** Using the calibration cards, run the force plate calibration protocol as instructed by [INSTRUCTOR]. This step is crucial for accurate data acquisition.
3.  **Baseline Measurement:** Without any perturbation, the participant reaches for the target, recording the data for 30 seconds.
4.  **Perturbation Introduction:**  [INSTRUCTOR: Protocol: Introduce perturbations by gently pushing the ruler horizontally away from the target. Starting with a small push (10 cm) and gradually increasing the amplitude to 30 cm over subsequent trials. Record data for 30 seconds per amplitude level.]
5.  **Data Collection:** The data acquisition system continuously records vertical acceleration data from the force plate during each trial.
6.  **Repeat:** Repeat steps 4 and 5 for three different perturbation amplitudes: 10 cm, 20 cm, and 30 cm.
7.  **Rest:** Allow the participant a 30 second rest period between each perturbation level.

**6. Data Collection (Table Template)**

| 2 | 10 |  |  |
| 3 | 10 |  |  |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 1 | 20 |  |  |

**7. Analysis Questions (5 questions)**

1.  How did the maximum vertical acceleration change with increasing perturbation amplitude? Explain this in terms of the brain's internal model.
2.  What visual cues likely contributed to the participant’s ability to anticipate and correct the perturbations?
3.  How did the subjective rating of “movement smoothness” correlate with the measured vertical acceleration data?
4.  Describe a potential feedback mechanism that could explain why the participant’s movement became smoother as the perturbation amplitude increased.
5.  If you were designing this experiment to investigate motor learning, what additional variables would you include to assess changes in the internal model over time?

**8. Expected Results (Detailed Explanation)**

Participants are expected to demonstrate an initial increase in vertical acceleration when reaching for the target with perturbations. As the perturbation amplitude increases, the participant will initially try to counteract the movement with a larger muscle contraction, resulting in even higher vertical acceleration.  As the perturbation amplitude reaches 30cm, the participant should exhibit a more refined response, with a reduced peak vertical acceleration and a greater movement smoothness. This reflects the brain's increasingly accurate internal model – the anticipatory muscle activation allowing for quicker, smoother corrections. The subjective rating of “movement smoothness” should generally align with the reduction in peak vertical acceleration. Data analysis will demonstrate a relationship between internal model accuracy and movement performance, showcasing the dynamic process of motor control.
