## Research Question 1: The Influence of Visual Feedback on Motor Adaptation to a Perturbing Force

**Methodology:** This investigation will utilize a reaching task within a controlled laboratory environment. Participants will be equipped with a force plate to accurately measure vertical acceleration during their reach.  The task involves reaching for a target positioned at varying distances. Initially, participants will perform the reach without any external force. Following a familiarization period, a sudden, unpredictable force (e.g., a puff of air) will be applied to the target during the reach.  We will manipulate the timing and magnitude of this force, recording the participant's response. The key measure will be the change in reaching trajectory – specifically, the deviation from the ideal, smooth reach – following the applied force.  Data will be collected over multiple trials, allowing us to assess the robustness of the adaptive response.  The experiment will be conducted with a sample size of 20 participants.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that participants will initially exhibit a disrupted reaching trajectory after encountering the force. However, over subsequent trials, we anticipate a significant adaptation – a return to a smoother, more efficient reaching path. This adaptation will demonstrate the brain's ability to integrate sensory information (force feedback) and adjust motor commands in real-time.  Specifically, we expect to see a reduction in the maximum vertical acceleration and a more consistent trajectory compared to the initial trials. The magnitude of this adaptation will be correlated with the strength of the force applied. The experiment should show robust motor adaption to a novel external perturbation.

## Research Question 2: Exploring the Role of the Cerebellum in Motor Correction Following a Disturbance

**Methodology:** This study will investigate the cerebellum’s contribution to motor correction using a reaching task with a novel timing disruption. Participants will complete a reaching task to a target, with a force plate recording their vertical acceleration. The experiment will employ a manipulated delay between the target appearance and the initiation of the reach.  A delayed target, meaning a small, randomized delay will be implemented, will disrupt the participant's motor command. This creates a novel, unpredictable motor demand. We will record their vertical acceleration using the force plate. Data will be analyzed to identify the change in reach speed, and the changes in trajectory. This will provide an insight into cerebellar function when faced with an unplanned external demand.

**Expected Outcomes:** We predict that participants will initially struggle with the delayed target, resulting in erratic, slower, and less accurate reaching.  We anticipate that the cerebellum’s involvement will lead to a rapid adaptive response.  Over subsequent trials, we expect the participants to demonstrate increasingly smoother, more accurate reaches and a more consistent pattern of acceleration – reflecting the cerebellum's ability to learn and compensate for the introduced delay.  Specifically, we expect to observe a reduction in the peak vertical acceleration and a more consistent trajectory, highlighting the cerebellum's role in correcting for the unexpected delay.

## Research Question 3: Quantifying the Change in Motor Response Latency Following a Motor Training Task

**Methodology:** This experiment will focus on a temporal aspect of motor control – assessing changes in reaction time. Participants will be trained to quickly reach for a target that appears at varying locations.  Their response time will be carefully measured using a reaction time measurement system. The experiment will involve three phases: a learning phase, a maintenance phase, and a testing phase. The test phase measures their response time when faced with a sudden change in target appearance. The goal is to determine how quickly participants adapt their motor response to the changing target appearance. Data will be collected for each participant and analyzed to identify patterns and trends.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that participants will initially exhibit a longer response time due to the unfamiliar motor command.  However, through repeated practice (the learning and maintenance phases), participants should demonstrate a significant reduction in their average response time – indicative of the cerebellum’s role in learning and optimizing motor sequences. We expect to observe a clear trend of decreasing response times over the training phases, indicating the cerebellum’s efficient learning of the movement sequence.  The experiment will reveal the impact of training on participants’ response time and the impact of motor adaption.
