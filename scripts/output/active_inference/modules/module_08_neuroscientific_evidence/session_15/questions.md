**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Which of the following best describes the concept of a ‘sensory illusion’?
A) A heightened sense of perception due to drug use
B) A misinterpretation of sensory information by the brain
C) A deliberate fabrication of sensory experiences
D) A permanent alteration in sensory pathways
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** A sensory illusion occurs when the brain incorrectly processes sensory input, leading to a perception that differs from the actual external stimulus. This highlights the brain's constructive role in shaping our reality.

**Question 3:**  During the lab exercise, what key measurement did the force plate provide to assess internal model accuracy?
A) Skin temperature variations
B) Vertical acceleration
C) Blood pressure fluctuations
D) Neural firing rates
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The force plate measured vertical acceleration, a direct indicator of movement adjustments made as the participant’s internal model attempted to correct for the introduced perturbations. This quantifies the system’s response to errors.

**Question 4:**  What is the significance of introducing deliberate perturbations during the reaching task?
A) To assess participant fatigue levels
B) To simulate the unpredictable nature of real-world movement
C) To evaluate participant’s reaction time
D) To measure the accuracy of target localization
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Perturbations mimic the disturbances encountered in everyday movement, forcing the brain to activate and refine its internal model for prediction and correction. This directly reflects real-world motor control.

**Question 5:**  How does the concept of an ‘internal model’ relate to the example of learning to ride a bicycle?
A) It indicates a complete understanding of balance from the outset.
B) It suggests that all movement is pre-programmed and instinctive.
C) It represents the gradual building of a predictive representation of movement based on experience.
D) It implies a reliance solely on sensory feedback during the learning process.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The internal model develops over time through practice, reflecting the brain’s ability to anticipate and compensate for movement errors – mirroring the initial wobbly bicycle riding.

**Question 6:**  Describe briefly the role of error signals in motor control?
**Answer:** Error signals are the discrepancies between a predicted movement and the actual movement. The brain uses these signals to update its internal model, adjusting future predictions and minimizing errors. This constant feedback loop is crucial for smooth and accurate movement.

**Question 7:**  Explain how the lab experiment might contribute to our understanding of how the cerebellum functions?
**Answer:** The lab’s focus on error correction and movement adjustments directly relates to the cerebellum’s role in motor coordination and balance. The force plate data provides insights into how the cerebellum fine-tunes motor commands to achieve precise and smooth movement – a fundamental aspect of cerebellar function.

**Question 8:**  In what ways might disruptions to the internal model lead to impaired motor performance?
**Answer:** If the internal model is inaccurate or incomplete, the brain will struggle to predict movement accurately, leading to jerky, unstable movements and difficulty in achieving desired outcomes. The individual’s ability to adjust to external forces would be compromised.

**Question 9:**  Considering the principles of internal models and error correction, how would you explain the phenomenon of “automatic” movements like walking?
**Answer:** Walking is largely automatic because the brain has constructed a highly refined internal model of the movement, allowing it to execute the sequence of steps with minimal conscious thought. The internal model anticipates and compensates for the complexities of terrain and momentum.

**Question 10:**  Describe a potential real-world application of understanding internal models of movement (e.g., robotics, rehabilitation)?
**Answer:** Understanding internal models is crucial for developing more sophisticated robots that can navigate complex environments without explicit programming, or for designing rehabilitation programs that target the brain’s ability to rebuild accurate internal models after injury – promoting recovery of motor function.
