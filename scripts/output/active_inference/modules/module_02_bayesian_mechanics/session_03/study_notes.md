## Introduction

Welcome back to Bayesian Mechanics. In our previous session, we established the fundamental principles of probability – likelihood, prior, and evidence – setting the stage for understanding Bayesian inference. Recall that probability, at its core, describes the likelihood of an event occurring. However, probabilistic reasoning can be influenced by pre-existing beliefs. Bayesian inference provides a formalized method to update these beliefs in light of new evidence. This session will focus on calculating posterior distributions, the central outcome of this process. We’ll explore how prior beliefs interact with observed data to arrive at a refined understanding. Consider the scenario of estimating the lifespan of a machine. Initial observations might suggest a lifespan of 5 years, influenced by past experiences. However, a sudden, significant failure could drastically alter this initial estimate. Bayesian inference provides a systematic way to incorporate this new information.
