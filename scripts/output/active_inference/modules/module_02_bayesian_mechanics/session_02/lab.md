## Lab Focus: Marginal Probability

**Module: Bayesian Mechanics**
**Lab Number: 2**
**Lab Focus: Marginal Probability**

**1. Brief Background (98 words)**

This laboratory exercise directly follows our discussion of joint probability and its importance in Bayesian modeling. We’ve established that multiple events can be linked and quantified through joint probabilities.  Today, we shift our focus to understanding how to extract information from a joint probability distribution – a concept known as marginal probability. Marginal probability allows us to calculate the probability of a single event occurring, regardless of the occurrence of other related events. This process is crucial for interpreting data and refining our prior beliefs, forming the core of Bayesian inference.  We will explore calculating marginal probabilities through direct observation and practical application.

**2. Lab Objectives (4 Bullet Points)**

*   Calculate the marginal probability of a single event given observed data.
*   Interpret marginal probability distributions in terms of single event likelihood.
*   Apply a numerical method to determine the probability of a specific outcome.
*   Compare and contrast joint and marginal probability calculations.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   Six-Sided Dice (6)
*   Data Collection Sheets (provided - see section 6)
*   Pencils (6)
*   Calculator (optional)
*   Coin (1)
*   Small Container (for coin)
*   Timer (1 minute)

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

*   **Eye Protection:** Wear safety goggles at all times. ⚠️  Failure to wear goggles could result in serious eye injury from accidental impact of dice.
*   **Surface Protection:**  Work on a stable surface to prevent damage to equipment and potential tripping hazards. ⚠️ Avoid placing dice on edges or unstable surfaces.
*   **Time-Sensitive Step:** Step 4 requires a precise 1-minute timer. Failure to adhere to the timing could introduce variability and affect accuracy.

**5. Procedure (6 Steps)**

1.  **Setup:** Each student will receive six dice.  Place the coin in the small container.
2.  **Roll Dice (Part 1):** Roll all six dice simultaneously. Record the outcome on your data collection sheet.
3.  **Roll Dice (Part 2):** Repeat steps 2 for a total of 10 trials.
4.  **Time:** Each trial should be performed within a 1-minute time limit.
5.  **Data Collection:** After each trial, record the sum of the dice rolls on your data collection sheet.
6. **Analysis:** Calculate the marginal probability of rolling a sum of 7 from the six dice.

**6. Data Collection**

| Trial | Dice Roll Sum | Marginal Probability of Sum = 7 |

| 2     |               |                                  |
| 3     |               |                                  |
| 4     |               |                                  |
| 5     |               |                                  |
| 6     |               |                                  |
| 7     |               |                                  |
| 8     |               |                                  |
| 9     |               |                                  |
| 10    |               |                                  |

**7. Analysis Questions (4 Questions)**

1.  What is the marginal probability of rolling a sum of 7 with six dice? Justify your answer.
2.  Consider the 10 trials. How does the frequency of rolling a sum of 7 relate to the marginal probability you calculated?
3.  How would the calculation of a marginal probability change if we were only interested in the probability of rolling a 6 on a single die after 10 rolls?
4.  Explain, in your own words, how calculating a marginal probability differs from calculating a joint probability.

**8. Expected Results (2 Sentences)**

Students should observe a frequency of approximately 1/6 (16.67%) of rolling a sum of 7 over 10 trials. This reflects the marginal probability derived from the joint probability distribution of the six dice rolls, representing the likelihood of a single outcome occurring.
