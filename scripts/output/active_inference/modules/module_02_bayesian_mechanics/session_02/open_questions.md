## Open Question 1: What is the mechanism of protein aggregation in Alzheimer's Disease?

Context: Research increasingly points to protein aggregation—particularly amyloid-beta and tau—as central drivers of Alzheimer's Disease. However, the precise mechanisms governing their formation, propagation, and ultimately, neuronal damage remain poorly understood. Recent studies suggest complex interactions involving lipid membranes, immune responses, and cellular stress pathways.  Investigating these processes is vital for developing targeted therapies. Current research is focused on identifying specific factors accelerating aggregation and exploring methods to disrupt these processes.

## Open Question 2: How does the gut microbiome influence neuroinflammation in Parkinson's Disease?

Context: Emerging evidence demonstrates a bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain, often termed the "gut-brain axis." Dysbiosis – an imbalance in the gut microbiome – is linked to increased neuroinflammation, a hallmark of Parkinson’s Disease. Specific bacterial metabolites are implicated in triggering immune responses and exacerbating neuronal damage. Current research leverages metagenomics and animal models to elucidate the specific bacterial strains and metabolites responsible and to determine if manipulating the microbiome could alleviate neuroinflammation.

## Open Question 3: What are the implications of CRISPR-based gene editing for mitochondrial dysfunction in Huntington’s Disease?

Context: Huntington’s Disease is characterized by progressive mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal degeneration.  CRISPR-Cas9 technology offers a potential avenue for correcting or silencing mutated genes responsible for this dysfunction. However,  challenges remain regarding off-target effects, delivery methods to affected neurons, and the potential for inducing unintended cellular responses. Current research is focusing on improving delivery techniques, identifying specific mitochondrial genes, and testing the feasibility of CRISPR-based interventions while carefully monitoring for adverse effects.
