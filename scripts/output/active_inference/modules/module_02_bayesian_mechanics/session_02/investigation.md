the output generated based on your detailed requirements and formatting specifications. I've focused on creating three distinct research questions, each with a methodology and expected outcome, all presented with the correct formatting.

## Research Question 1: The Impact of Social Media Usage on Adolescent Mental Wellbeing

**Methodology:** This research will employ a mixed-methods approach. Initially, a quantitative survey will be distributed to 200 adolescents (aged 13-18) using a validated instrument measuring social media usage patterns (frequency, platforms used, types of content consumed) and standardized scales for assessing anxiety, depression, and self-esteem. Correlation analysis will be performed to determine the relationships between these variables.  Subsequently, in-depth semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a subset of 20 adolescents selected based on survey responses (high vs. low social media usage, high vs. low wellbeing scores) to explore the *qualitative* nuances of their experiences. Interview questions will focus on themes identified during the initial survey phase, such as social comparison, cyberbullying, and feelings of connection.  Data from both the survey and interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify recurring patterns and insights.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate finding a moderate positive correlation between high social media usage (particularly platforms associated with image-based content) and elevated levels of anxiety and depression symptoms.  Furthermore, we expect to identify specific themes within the qualitative data related to the impact of social comparison, fear of missing out (FOMO), and experiences of cyberbullying.  The research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between social media and adolescent mental wellbeing, providing evidence-based insights for developing targeted interventions and promoting responsible social media usage.  Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations to stakeholders including schools, mental health organizations, and social media companies.

## Research Question 2: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Mindfulness Training on Reducing Test Anxiety

**Methodology:** This investigation will utilize a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design.  100 undergraduate students enrolled in introductory psychology courses will be recruited to participate. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a mindfulness training group (n=50) or a control group (n=50). The mindfulness training group will participate in an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program, involving weekly group sessions led by a qualified instructor. The control group will receive standard academic support resources. Prior to and immediately following the 8-week intervention, all participants will complete a battery of psychological assessments, including the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and a standardized test anxiety measure. Data will be analyzed using independent samples t-tests and repeated measures ANOVA to assess changes in anxiety levels between the groups.  Furthermore, qualitative data, collected via short open-ended questionnaires after the intervention, will explore participant perceptions of the training’s helpfulness.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that the mindfulness training group will demonstrate a significant reduction in self-reported test anxiety compared to the control group.  We expect to observe a decrease in both state and trait anxiety levels within the mindfulness group. The qualitative data should reveal that participants in the mindfulness group found the techniques helpful for managing pre-test jitters and promoting a calmer, more focused mindset. The findings will support the efficacy of mindfulness training as a viable strategy for mitigating test anxiety, potentially informing university wellness programs and student support services. Data will be presented at a student psychology conference and submitted for publication to the *Journal of College Student Development*.

## Research Question 3:  Analyzing the Impact of Urban Green Spaces on Resident Stress Levels

**Methodology:** This research will employ a longitudinal observational study.  Data will be collected from 150 residents living within a 1-mile radius of three designated urban green spaces (parks) and a control area (a similarly situated residential zone without significant green spaces).  Participants will be recruited through local community groups and flyers.  Baseline data will be collected using validated self-report questionnaires measuring perceived stress levels (Perceived Stress Scale - PSS) and measures of social connectedness. Over a period of six months, participants' location data (using smartphone tracking – with informed consent) will be collected passively, along with environmental data (e.g., air quality, temperature, noise levels).  Statistical analysis (correlation, regression) will be used to assess the relationship between exposure to green spaces (derived from location data and environmental variables) and changes in PSS scores over time.  A subset of 20 participants will be interviewed to understand their subjective experiences and perceptions of the green spaces.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate finding a negative correlation between time spent in or proximity to urban green spaces and increased levels of perceived stress.  Specifically, we expect that individuals who regularly utilize the green spaces will exhibit lower PSS scores compared to those with limited exposure.  The interview data will provide valuable contextual information, revealing how residents utilize the green spaces and the perceived benefits they derive from them (e.g., relaxation, social interaction, improved mood).  The results will contribute to the body of knowledge regarding the psychological benefits of urban green infrastructure and inform urban planning policies aimed at promoting resident wellbeing.  Final findings will be compiled into a report for the city planning department and a presentation for a regional environmental association.
