## Introduction

Welcome back to Bayesian Mechanics. Last week, we established the foundational principles of Bayesian inference – reasoning under uncertainty using prior beliefs and observed data. This session builds directly on that, focusing on the bedrock of probabilistic modeling: probability theory. Specifically, we’ll revisit key probability concepts, including joint probability, marginal probability, and, crucially, Bayes’ Theorem. Our aim is to solidify your understanding of these concepts, as they are absolutely essential for effectively applying Bayesian mechanics. Many of the techniques we'll explore later rely heavily on a firm grasp of these fundamentals. Consider this session a critical reinforcement of your statistical toolkit.

## Further Notes & Considerations

*   Bayes’ Theorem is a cornerstone of Bayesian inference and is heavily used in applications like medical diagnosis, machine learning, and scientific modeling.
*   The prior probability plays a crucial role; a strong prior can significantly influence the posterior, even with relatively weak evidence.
*   Understanding the assumptions underlying different probability distributions is paramount for accurate modeling.
*   Calculating P(B) in Bayes’ Theorem (the denominator) can often be challenging and may require integration over all possible values of the variables involved.
