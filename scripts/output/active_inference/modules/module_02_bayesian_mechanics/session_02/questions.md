**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Which of the following best describes the concept of marginal probability?
A) The probability of two or more events occurring simultaneously.
B) The probability of a single event occurring, regardless of other related events.
C) The probability of an event occurring given specific conditions.
D) The probability of an event occurring before another event.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Marginal probability focuses on the likelihood of a single event happening, irrespective of the occurrence of other linked events. It’s derived from a joint probability distribution by summing over all possible combinations of other events.

**Question 3:**  If a standard six-sided die is rolled twice, what is the probability of rolling a 2 on the first roll and a 6 on the second roll?
A) 1/36
B) 1/6
C) 1/3
D) 1/2
**Answer:** A
**Explanation:** The two rolls are independent events. The probability of rolling a 2 on one roll is 1/6, and the probability of rolling a 6 on another roll is 1/6. Multiplying these probabilities yields 1/36.

**Question 4:**  What is the key difference between a joint probability distribution and a marginal probability distribution?
A) A joint distribution considers only one event, while a marginal distribution considers multiple.
B) A joint distribution describes multiple events simultaneously, while a marginal distribution isolates a single event.
C)  A marginal distribution is always smaller than a joint distribution.
D)  Both distributions are identical in their representation of probability.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Joint probability describes the simultaneous likelihood of multiple events, while marginal probability extracts the probability of a single event by summing across all combinations of other events within the joint distribution.

**Question 5:**  A coin is flipped three times. What is the probability of getting exactly two heads?
A) 1/8
B) 1/4
C) 3/8
D) 1/2
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** There are 8 possible outcomes (HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT).  The combinations resulting in exactly two heads are HHT, HTH, and THH. Therefore, the probability is 3/8.

**Question 6:**  Explain the role of prior beliefs in Bayesian mechanics?
**Answer:** Prior beliefs represent our initial assumptions about a system's state before observing any new datA) These beliefs are quantified as probability distributions, providing a foundation for updating our understanding as evidence accumulates. They are crucial for guiding inference and influencing the final probability estimates.

**Question 7:**  Describe a real-world scenario where understanding joint probability would be beneficial.?
**Answer:** Predicting traffic patterns based on multiple factors (time of day, weather, day of the week) demonstrates the need for joint probability. Analyzing how these factors simultaneously influence traffic volume allows for more accurate forecasting than considering them independently.

**Question 8:**  Explain how marginal probability helps refine our understanding of data.?
**Answer:** By calculating marginal probabilities, we can determine the likelihood of specific outcomes based on observed datA) This process effectively isolates the relevant information, allowing us to update our prior beliefs and develop a more accurate model of the system.

**Question 9:**  Considering a standard deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of drawing an Ace of Spades followed by a King?
**Answer:** The probability of drawing the Ace of Spades first is 1/52.  After removing this card, there are 51 cards left. The probability of drawing a King from the remaining cards is 4/51.  The combined probability is (4/51) * (1/51) = 4/2601.

**Question 10:**  How does Bayesian mechanics differ from frequentist statistics?
**Answer:** Bayesian mechanics incorporates prior beliefs directly into probability calculations, updating them based on observed datA) Frequentist statistics relies solely on observed data, without explicit consideration of prior beliefs – treating probabilities as frequencies of repeated events.
