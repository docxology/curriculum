## Topic 1: Metabolic Reprogramming for Cancer Therapy
Recent research has shifted focus towards metabolic reprogramming as a core strategy in cancer therapy.  Traditional chemotherapy often indiscriminately attacks rapidly dividing cells, including healthy ones, leading to significant side effects. However, many cancers exhibit a distinct metabolic profile – often relying heavily on glycolysis, even in the presence of sufficient oxygen (the Warburg effect).  Current investigations are exploring targeted metabolic interventions. These include inhibiting key enzymes in glycolytic pathways (e.g., hexokinase, pyruvate kinase), blocking mitochondrial respiration, or disrupting nutrient uptake.  Emerging areas involve personalized medicine, analyzing individual tumor metabolic fingerprints to tailor specific interventions. Furthermore, combining metabolic therapies with immunotherapy shows promise, as metabolically ‘starved’ cancer cells become more susceptible to immune attack.  The development of novel small molecule inhibitors and genetic tools is driving significant advancements in this field, with potential for improved efficacy and reduced toxicity.

## Topic 2:  Synthetic Biology and Microbial Fuel Cells
Synthetic biology is revolutionizing the design and construction of biological systems for a range of applications, and microbial fuel cells (MFCs) represent a particularly exciting area. MFCs utilize microorganisms to catalyze the oxidation of organic matter, directly generating electricity. Current research is focused on enhancing the efficiency and stability of these systems. This involves optimizing microbial communities through genetic engineering – creating specifically tailored consortia for improved substrate degradation and electron transfer.  Advanced materials are being developed to serve as electron mediators, facilitating efficient transfer of electrons from the microorganisms to electrodes.  Furthermore, researchers are investigating larger-scale MFC deployments for wastewater treatment and renewable energy generation.  The integration of MFCs with other biotechnologies, such as microbial electrolysis cells, expands their potential for generating clean energy and addressing environmental challenges. The development of robust, self-sustaining MFCs remains a significant goal.

## Topic 3:  Single-Cell Metabolic Analysis – Beyond Bulk Measurements
Traditional metabolic studies often rely on bulk measurements of metabolic pathways, providing an average representation of a cell population. However, significant heterogeneity exists within cell populations, with different cells exhibiting distinct metabolic states. Recent advances in single-cell metabolic analysis are providing unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity. Techniques like metabolic tracing combined with flow cytometry allow researchers to track the movement of specific metabolites within individual cells, revealing metabolic sub-populations.  This approach is particularly relevant in understanding complex tissues like the brain and tumors, where variations in metabolic activity can impact cell behavior.  Furthermore, the development of microfluidic devices allows for precise control over cellular microenvironments, enabling researchers to manipulate metabolic conditions and study the responses of individual cells in a controlled manner. The integration of single-cell metabolomics with other ‘omics’ data (genomics, proteomics) provides a holistic view of cellular metabolism.
