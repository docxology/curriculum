## Research Question 1: How does mitochondrial membrane composition influence the efficiency of the electron transport chain?

**Methodology:** This investigation will employ a comparative approach, analyzing mitochondrial samples isolated from two distinct yeast strains: *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (a model organism) and *Candida albicans* (a fungal species known for its robust membrane structure).  Each strain will be treated with a lipid extraction protocol followed by lipid analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to quantify the relative proportions of phospholipids, sterols, and other membrane components. Subsequently, purified mitochondria from both strains will be subjected to a controlled electron transport chain simulation using a redox gradient and electrochemical measurements. The rate of ATP production (measured via phosphate release) will be recorded under identical conditions. Statistical analysis (ANOVA and post-hoc tests) will be used to compare ATP production rates between the two strains. We’ll control for temperature and buffer conditions.

**Expected Outcomes:**  We hypothesize that *Candida albicans*, with its notably more complex and highly organized mitochondrial membrane, will exhibit a significantly higher ATP production rate compared to *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. This is predicted due to a greater density and more efficient arrangement of protein complexes within the electron transport chain, facilitated by the membrane's structural features.  We anticipate a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) in ATP production, demonstrating a correlation between membrane composition and electron transport chain efficiency.  The data will provide insights into the structural adaptations of mitochondria and their impact on cellular energy production.  The results will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of varying substrate concentrations on the rate of glycolysis in mammalian liver cells?

**Methodology:** This investigation will explore the effect of glucose concentration on glycolytic activity within cultured murine liver cells (HepG2 cells).  HepG2 cells will be cultured under standard conditions and then subjected to a series of experimental treatments. The cells will be divided into five groups: control (normal glucose concentration), low glucose (0.5 mM), intermediate glucose (2.5 mM), high glucose (10 mM), and very high glucose (25 mM). After a 24-hour incubation period, cells will be lysed, and the concentration of key glycolytic intermediates (e.g., pyruvate, lactate, and ATP) will be measured using enzymatic assays.  Cellular respiration rate will be assessed by measuring oxygen consumption.  Data will be analyzed using regression analysis to determine the relationship between substrate concentration and reaction rate.

**Expected Outcomes:** We predict that the glycolytic rate will initially increase proportionally with glucose concentration up to a certain point.  We anticipate that at high glucose concentrations (e.g., 25 mM), the glycolytic rate will plateau or even decrease due to the accumulation of inhibitory metabolites (e.g., dihydroxyacetone phosphate) or disruptions in enzyme function.  We expect to observe a positive correlation (r > 0.7) between glucose concentration and glycolytic flux, followed by a saturation point, and subsequent decline as the reaction is inhibited. These findings will contribute to understanding how cells respond to fluctuations in glucose availability and the limitations of glycolysis under stress conditions.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the concentration of ATP in a cell suspension?

**Methodology:** This investigation will involve the use of a bioluminescence assay to quantify ATP levels in a cell suspension.  The assay utilizes a luciferase enzyme that catalyzes a reaction producing light proportional to the amount of ATP present.  A commercially available ATP detection kit (e.g., luciferin and luciferase) will be employed.  A cell suspension of *E. coli* (a well-characterized bacterial strain) will be prepared. The cell suspension will be diluted to a specific optical density. The luminescence emitted from the cells will be measured using a luminometer. A calibration curve will be established using known ATP concentrations to determine the relationship between luminescence intensity and ATP concentration. The method will be repeated multiple times to assess reproducibility and ensure accuracy.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate a linear correlation between ATP concentration and luminescence intensity, allowing us to accurately quantify ATP levels within the cell suspension. The sensitivity and dynamic range of the assay will be determined.  Standard deviation measurements will be conducted to assess the precision and reliability of the method.  This established protocol will provide a valuable tool for researchers studying ATP levels in various cellular processes and biological systems. The procedure’s robustness will be tested across different cell types and conditions.
