**Question 1:** Which of the following best describes the central dogma of molecular biology?
A) DNA directly codes for proteins without RNA involvement?
B) RNA directly codes for DNA, which then codes for proteins?
C) DNA, RNA, and protein are sequentially involved in gene expression?
D) Protein synthesis is the primary driver of cellular function?
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The central dogma outlines the flow of genetic information: DNA is transcribed into RNA, and RNA is translated into protein. This sequential process underpins all cellular activities and information transfer.

**Question 2:** What is the primary purpose of the Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle)?
A) To directly produce large amounts of ATP?
B) To synthesize DNA and RNA molecules?
C) To oxidize acetyl-CoA, releasing energy and generating key molecules?
D) To break down glucose into pyruvate?
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The Krebs cycle’s main function is to oxidize acetyl-CoA, capturing energy released and generating molecules like NADH and FADH2, which fuel the electron transport chain.

**Question 3:**  Glycolysis occurs in which cellular compartment?
A) Nucleus
B) Mitochondria
C) Cytoplasm
D) Golgi apparatus
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Glycolysis, the initial breakdown of glucose, takes place entirely within the cytoplasm of the cell, independent of any membrane-bound organelles.

**Question 4:** What role do enzymes play in metabolic pathways?
A) They consume energy during reaction acceleration?
B) They act as catalysts, speeding up reaction rates without being consumed?
C) They directly transport glucose molecules across cell membranes?
D) They solely regulate gene expression during cellular processes?
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Enzymes are biological catalysts that lower the activation energy of reactions, enabling them to proceed more rapidly, while themselves remaining unchanged in the process.

**Question 5:**  Which of the following statements accurately reflects the relationship between catabolic and anabolic pathways?
A) Catabolic pathways only produce energy, while anabolic pathways consume it?
B) Catabolic and anabolic pathways are entirely independent of each other?
C) Catabolic and anabolic pathways are interconnected, forming a dynamic equilibrium?
D) Catabolic pathways exclusively generate ATP, and anabolic pathways generate ADP?
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Catabolic and anabolic pathways are intrinsically linked; catabolism breaks down molecules releasing energy, while anabolism utilizes that energy to build complex molecules, creating a continuous cycle.

**Question 6:** Describe the function of the electron transport chain?
**Answer:** The electron transport chain utilizes the energy stored in NADH and FADH2 to create a proton gradient across a membrane. This gradient then drives the synthesis of ATP through a process called oxidative phosphorylation, generating the majority of ATP within the cell.

**Question 7:**  Explain how ATP production is linked to the Krebs cycle?
**Answer:** The Krebs cycle generates electron carriers (NADH and FADH2) which subsequently donate their electrons to the electron transport chain.  The energy released from this electron transfer drives the synthesis of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, making the Krebs cycle a critical step in energy production.

**Question 8:**  How does the lab exercise simulate the concepts covered in the lecture?
**Answer:** The lab exercise uses a simulated enzymatic cascade to visually demonstrate the sequential steps of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. By observing color changes and reaction mixture alterations, students can directly observe the flow of energy and the production of key molecules, reinforcing the concepts of catabolic and anabolic processes.

**Question 9:**  Provide a real-world example where understanding metabolic pathways is crucial?
**Answer:**  Understanding metabolic pathways is crucial in developing treatments for metabolic disorders like diabetes, where imbalances in glucose metabolism impact energy production and overall health.  Similarly, it’s essential in designing effective diets and exercise programs for weight management.

**Question 10:**  Synthesize the roles of enzymes, the electron transport chain, and ATP production in the context of cellular respiration.?
**Answer:** Cellular respiration relies on a coordinated system where enzymes catalyze key reactions, the electron transport chain efficiently extracts energy from electron carriers, and ATP synthase utilizes this energy to synthesize ATP.  This integrated process represents the primary means by which cells obtain and utilize energy for their vital functions.
