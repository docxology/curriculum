## Open Question 1: What is the mechanism of cellular senescence and its role in age-related diseases?

Context: Cellular senescence is increasingly recognized as a critical driver of age-related diseases, including arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders.  Current research is focused on identifying the specific molecular signals triggering senescence and how these senescent cells contribute to chronic inflammation and tissue dysfunction.  Understanding the precise mechanisms allows for potential therapeutic interventions. Current research: Epigenetics, Senolytic drug discovery.

## Open Question 2: How does the gut microbiome influence neuroinflammation and mental health disorders?

Context: The gut-brain axis is now widely recognized as a bidirectional communication network. Recent studies reveal a strong link between alterations in the gut microbiome and neuroinflammation – a key factor in conditions like depression, anxiety, and Alzheimer's disease. Research is exploring the specific microbial metabolites and signaling pathways involved in this interaction. Current research: Metabolomics, Animal models of neuroinflammation.

## Open Question 3: What are the implications of epigenetic drift for predicting cancer progression and treatment response?

Context: Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone alterations, can significantly impact gene expression and are frequently dysregulated in cancer. "Epigenetic drift," where these modifications accumulate over time, may predict the trajectory of tumor development and influence a patient’s response to specific therapies. Current research: Genomic sequencing, Predictive biomarkers in oncology.
