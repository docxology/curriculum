## Lab Focus: Summary & Review

---

**Module 20: Summary & Review – Metabolic Pathway Observation**

**1. Brief Background (87 words)**

Following our exploration of cellular metabolism, this laboratory exercise provides a hands-on opportunity to visualize and briefly observe the interconnectedness of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. We will utilize a model system – a simulated enzymatic cascade – to represent key steps, reinforcing the concepts of catabolic and anabolic processes and the flow of energy within these pathways. This activity aims to solidify understanding of the cyclical nature of metabolic reactions and their crucial role in energy production. [INSTRUCTOR: Remind students of the lecture’s focus on ATP production.]

**2. Lab Objectives (4 bullet points)**

*   Observe the sequential steps of a simplified glycolysis model.
*   Identify indicators of metabolic activity (color change).
*   Record changes in the simulated reaction mixture over time.
*   Compare and contrast the input and output components of the simulated pathway.
*   Analyze the relationship between reaction time and observable changes.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   **Chemicals:**
    *   Glucose Solution (1% w/v in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) - 50 mL
    *   ATP Indicator Solution (prepared as per recipe – see Appendix A) – 5 mL
    *   Reaction Buffer (pH 7.4) – 45 mL
    *   Enzyme A Solution (0.1 M) - 2 mL
    *   Enzyme B Solution (0.1 M) - 2 mL
*   **Equipment:**
    *   50 mL Beaker (x2)
    *   Graduated Cylinders (10 mL, 25 mL)
    *   Test Tubes (x10)
    *   Thermometer
    *   Stopwatch
    *   Magnetic Stirrer
    *   Pipettes (1 mL, 5 mL)

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

⚠️ **Chemical Hazards:** ATP Indicator Solution contains components which can cause skin irritation. Avoid direct contact. ⚠️ **Biological Hazards:** While this exercise uses a simulated system, handle all solutions with care. ⚠️ **Physical Hazards:** Use caution when handling glassware and equipment to prevent breakage and potential cuts.  Maintain a clean workspace. Dispose of all solutions according to [INSTRUCTOR: Specify disposal protocol – e.g., laboratory waste disposal guidelines].  Wear appropriate PPE at all times.

**5. Procedure (7 steps)**

1.  Label two test tubes as “Tube A” and “Tube B.”
2.  Add 40 mL of Reaction Buffer to each test tube.
3.  Add 1 mL of Glucose Solution to Tube A.  To Tube B, add 1 mL of Reaction Buffer only (control).
4.  Using a pipette, add 1 mL of Enzyme A Solution to Tube A. Gently swirl to mix.
5.  Initiate the reaction by adding 1 mL of Enzyme B Solution to Tube A. Immediately start the stopwatch.
6.  Observe Tube A every 30 seconds for a total of 5 minutes.  Record observations in the data table.  Observe Tube B as a control.
7.  At 5 minutes, stop the reaction and dispose of the solutions according to laboratory protocols.

**6. Data Collection**

| Time (seconds) | Tube A (Color Change) | Tube B (Control) | Observations (Notes) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 |  |  | Initial appearance of both solutions. |
| 30 |  |  |  |
| 60 |  |  |  |
| 90 |  |  |  |
| 120 |  |  |  |
| 150 |  |  |  |
| 180 |  |  |  |
| 210 |  |  |  |
| 240 |  |  |  |
| 270 |  |  |  |

**7. Analysis Questions (4 questions)**

1.  Describe the changes you observed in Tube A over the 5-minute period. What color changes occurred, and in what order did they appear?
2.  How did the changes in Tube A compare to the control (Tube B)? Explain the significance of the control group.
3.  Relate the changes observed in the lab to the overall process of glycolysis, including the role of enzymes.
4.  If the rate of the color change in Tube A increased, what factor could potentially contribute to this change (consider the concepts learned in previous lectures)?

**8. Expected Results (4 statements)**

1.  Students should observe a gradual color change in Tube A, starting with a pale yellow and progressing to a deeper color within the 5-minute period. This change represents the production of ATP indicator.
2.  Tube B (the control) should remain largely unchanged, demonstrating the absence of enzymatic activity.
3.  The color change represents the consumption of glucose and subsequent ATP production, mirroring the first steps of glycolysis.
4.  Increased reaction speed is anticipated with careful stirring, mimicking the catalytic effect of enzymes. [INSTRUCTOR: Add a reminder that this is a simplified model.]
