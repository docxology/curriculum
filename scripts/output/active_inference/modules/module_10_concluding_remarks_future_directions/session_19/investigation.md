Okay, let's craft the research questions and associated documentation, adhering strictly to the specified format and guidelines.

## Research Question 1: How does the level of background noise impact the accuracy of signal detection in simulated sensory environments?

**Methodology:** This investigation will employ a simulated sensory environment, mimicking a basic auditory or visual stimulus. The environment will be programmed to generate a clear, identifiable signal.  Subsequently, varying levels of simulated “background noise” will be introduced (e.g., white noise, random patterns). Participants (undergraduate students) will be tasked with identifying the presence and characteristics of the target signal within the noisy environment.  Accuracy will be measured by the percentage of correctly identified instances of the signal compared to the total number of trials. Data will be collected through a software interface recording participant responses and the noise level applied during each trial. We will conduct a repeated measures design, with participants exposed to a range of noise levels. Statistical analysis (ANOVA, t-tests) will be used to determine the relationship between noise level and accuracy.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate a negative correlation between the level of background noise and the accuracy of signal detection. As noise increases, the percentage of correctly identified signals will decrease. We expect the effect to be statistically significant, demonstrating a clear impact of noise on sensory perception. Further, we will explore the relationship between different noise types and the degree of disruption they cause.  The results will provide empirical evidence of the significant challenge that noise poses to signal detection and contribute to a better understanding of perceptual limitations.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of varying stimulus duration on memory recall in a laboratory setting?

**Methodology:** Participants will be presented with a series of visual stimuli (e.g., images or shapes) for a fixed, short duration (e.g., 3 seconds). Immediately following this exposure, participants will be given a 30-second window to recall as many details of the stimulus as possible. The duration of the stimulus exposure will be manipulated systematically, varying from 1 second to 5 seconds.  The number of recalled features will be quantified by the number of attributes participants correctly identify. Data will be recorded using a computer-based interface, allowing for precise control over stimulus presentation and data collection. A within-subjects design will be employed, ensuring each participant experiences all stimulus durations. Statistical analysis (ANOVA, post-hoc tests) will be used to determine if there’s a significant relationship between stimulus duration and memory recall.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that longer stimulus durations will lead to greater memory recall, up to a certain point.  Initially, increased exposure will enhance encoding. However, excessive exposure may lead to cognitive overload and diminishing returns. We anticipate a bell-shaped curve, where the highest recall occurs within an optimal duration range, followed by a decline in recall with increasing exposure time. This investigation will contribute to the understanding of the ‘encoding specificity principle,’ demonstrating the influence of temporal factors on memory formation.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the impact of different filtering techniques on removing signal distortion from white noise?

**Methodology:** This study will implement several filtering techniques (e.g., moving average, median filter, Butterworth filter) on a dataset of white noise. The white noise data will be generated using a software tool that allows precise control over its characteristics (amplitude, frequency content). The filtered data will be analyzed for its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral characteristics.  The SNR will be calculated as the ratio of the signal power to the noise power. Spectral analysis will be conducted to examine the frequency distribution of the filtered signal. The effectiveness of each filtering technique will be evaluated by comparing the resulting SNR and spectral characteristics to the original white noise.  The results will be recorded through data logging software and analyzed using statistical methods (e.g., ANOVA).

**Expected Outcomes:** We predict that different filtering techniques will have varying degrees of success in reducing the impact of white noise. The moving average filter might provide the most effective reduction, while the median filter may introduce smoothing effects, and the Butterworth filter may provide optimal frequency selectivity.  The study will demonstrate the trade-offs between different filtering approaches, providing insights into signal processing strategies for reducing noise distortion in various contexts.  The results will contribute to a better understanding of signal processing techniques and their effectiveness in mitigating noise contamination.
