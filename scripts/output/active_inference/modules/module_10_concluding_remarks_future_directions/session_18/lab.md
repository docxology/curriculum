**Lab Focus: Agency**

**Module: Concluding Remarks & Future Directions**
**Related Topics:** Embodied Cognition, Agency

**1. Brief Background (87 words):**

This lab builds upon our discussion of embodied cognition and the challenge to Cartesian dualism. Traditionally, philosophers and scientists have treated the mind as an independent entity interacting with a body. However, research in embodied cognition suggests that our cognitive processes are deeply intertwined with our physical experiences. This exercise will explore how the act of manipulating an object, even seemingly simple actions, fundamentally alters our perceptions and subsequently, our sense of agency – the feeling that we are in control of our actions.  [INSTRUCTOR: Briefly recap proprioception and its role.]

**2. Lab Objectives:**

*   Manipulate a simple object to elicit and measure changes in subjective experience.
*   Record observations of changes in perception and the sense of agency.
*   Analyze how physical action impacts reported feelings of control.
*   Compare and contrast subjective reports with observable physical actions.
*   Evaluate the potential for embodied experience to influence the perception of free will.

**3. Materials and Equipment:**

*   **Objects:** 10 identical smooth wooden blocks (6cm x 6cm x 6cm)
*   **Measuring Tools:** Ruler (accurate to 1mm)
*   **Data Recording:**
    *   Whiteboards (1 per group of 3-4 students)
    *   Dry-erase markers (3 per group)
    *   Clipboards (1 per group)
    *   Pens (3 per group)
*   **Timekeeping:** Stopwatch
*   **Computer:** For data logging (optional – alternative is a manual data table).

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️):**

*   **Physical Hazard:** Risk of minor bumps or scrapes from objects. Ensure a clear, uncluttered workspace. Students should maintain a safe distance from each other.
*   **Vision Hazard:** Ensure adequate lighting to prevent eye strain.  Avoid reflective surfaces that could cause glare.
*   **PPE Requirements:** Safety glasses (ANSI Z87.1 rated) – *mandatory* at all times during the experiment.  Closed-toe shoes are required.
*   **Time-Sensitive Step:** Step 5 – Block Release:  Students should release the block gently to avoid forceful impact.

**5. Procedure:**

1.  **Group Formation:** Students form groups of 3-4.
2.  **Preparation:** Each group receives 10 wooden blocks and a whiteboard.
3.  **Baseline Assessment (2 minutes):**  Without manipulating any block, each student spends 2 minutes writing down their subjective feelings about control – specifically, the degree to which they feel they have control over their movements and the world around them (1 = no control, 10 = complete control). Record this on the whiteboard.
4.  **Manipulation Phase (5 minutes):**  Each student selects a block. Without any pre-determined goal, they repeatedly manipulate the block – lifting, dropping, rotating, and pushing it around. Focus on the sensory experience of the manipulation.
5.  **Post-Manipulation Assessment (2 minutes):**  After the 5 minutes of manipulation, each student *immediately* records their subjective feelings about control again, on the whiteboard.
6.  **Repeat:** Each student repeats steps 4-6 with 5 different blocks.
7.  **Data Consolidation:** Groups consolidate their individual data into a single data table.

**6. Data Collection:**

|           |   6    |                           |                                 |                                           |
|           |   7    |                           |                                 |                                           |
|           |   8    |                           |                                 |                                           |

**7. Analysis Questions:**

1.  Did your subjective rating of control change after manipulating the block? If so, how much?
2.  Describe any specific sensations you experienced while manipulating the block – were they related to your perception of control?
3.  How do your observations support or challenge the idea that our bodies shape our thoughts?
4.  Considering the philosophical debate surrounding free will, how might embodied cognition influence our understanding of this concept?
5.  If manipulating a block *fundamentally* alters your perception, does this suggest we are less "free" than we think, or does it demonstrate the deep connection between physical action and conscious experience?

**8. Expected Results:**

Students are expected to observe a *tendency* for their subjective ratings of control to increase after manipulating the block. Students should report experiencing specific tactile sensations (e.g., feeling the friction, the weight of the block) and describing how these sensations relate to their feelings of control. Consistent data across groups is anticipated. It is expected that the manipulation will trigger a noticeable change in their subjective reports, highlighting the interconnectedness of physical action and conscious experience.
