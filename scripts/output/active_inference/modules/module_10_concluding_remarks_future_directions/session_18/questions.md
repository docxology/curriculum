**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:**  What is the central tenet of Cartesian dualism?
A) The mind and body are identical substances.
B) The mind is an illusion generated by the brain.
C) The mind and body interact through the pineal gland.
D) Consciousness arises solely from physical processes.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Cartesian dualism posits a fundamental separation between the mind and body, proposing that the mind interacts with the physical body via a specific point, traditionally the pineal gland. This reflects a belief in a non-physical mental substance.

**Question 3:**  How does embodied cognition challenge traditional philosophical views?
A) It confirms the existence of a soul.
B) It reinforces the idea of a disembodied mind.
C) It suggests that cognition is shaped by bodily experience.
D) It proves that all mental processes are purely electrical.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Embodied cognition argues that cognitive processes aren't just *produced* by the brain, but are actually *shaped* by our bodies’ interactions with the world, shifting away from a purely brain-centric view.

**Question 4:**  What is proprioception?
A) The ability to perceive color.
B) The sense of where our body parts are in space.
C) The detection of sound waves.
D) The processing of olfactory information.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Proprioception is the sense that allows us to know the position and movement of our body parts in space, influenced by sensory feedback and motor control.

**Question 5:**  Why is the concept of agency relevant to the discussion of embodied cognition?
A) It demonstrates the limitations of human free will.
B) It highlights the influence of physical action on perception and experience.
C) It focuses solely on the neurological basis of decision-making.
D) It reinforces the idea that thoughts are completely detached from physical reality.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Agency, the feeling of control over our actions, is deeply intertwined with embodied cognition – physical action fundamentally alters our perceptions and subsequently, our sense of control.

**Question 6:**  Describe the key difference between a prokaryotic cell and a eukaryotic cell?
**Answer:** Prokaryotic cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles, representing a simpler cell structure. Eukaryotic cells, conversely, possess a nucleus and various membrane-bound organelles, contributing to a more complex and organized cellular design.

**Question 7:**  How might manipulating a block influence your perceived sense of agency?
**Answer:**  Actively manipulating the block—specifically the physical effort of pushing, lifting, or rotating it—will likely intensify the sense of agency.  This is because the action directly engages our body and nervous system, reinforcing the feeling that we are intentionally controlling the object’s movement.

**Question 8:**  Explain how embodied cognition can be applied to understand human social behavior?
**Answer:** Embodied cognition suggests that our social interactions are not just based on abstract thoughts but are profoundly influenced by our physical experiences and bodily states. For example, a person experiencing discomfort might unconsciously exhibit defensive behaviors, highlighting the connection between physical sensations and social responses.

**Question 9:**  Discuss the potential implications of embodied cognition for the debate surrounding free will.?
**Answer:** If our cognitive processes are shaped by our bodies' interactions with the environment, it challenges the notion of a completely autonomous, uninfluenced minD) This suggests a greater role for physical factors and sensory experiences in our decisions, potentially blurring the lines of traditional free will arguments.

**Question 10:**  Considering the lab exercise involving manipulating the wooden block, what specific data could be collected to further investigate the link between physical action and perceived agency?
**Answer:** Data could include measurements of the force applied to the block, time taken to perform specific actions, subjective ratings of control on a scale (e.g., 1-10), and detailed observational notes documenting any changes in facial expressions, body posture, or verbal responses during the manipulation.
