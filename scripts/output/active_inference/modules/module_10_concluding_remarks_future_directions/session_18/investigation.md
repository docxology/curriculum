Okay, here’s the research question content, formatted precisely as requested, ready for incorporation into your lesson or activity.

## Research Question 1: How does the force applied during the block manipulation affect the perceived sense of control?

**Methodology:** This investigation will employ a within-subjects design. Each participant will manipulate the wooden block (a standard, 10cm x 5cm x 2cm block) five times.  Each manipulation will be recorded using a high-speed camera to capture the force applied, the path of movement, and the participant’s body position.  Participants will be asked to consciously focus on their movement, attempting to exert a specific force (identified verbally beforehand) during each manipulation.  Following each manipulation, participants will rate their perceived sense of control on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = No Control, 7 = Complete Control) immediately after the recording.  Physiological data, including heart rate variability (HRV) will also be collected to provide a biological measure of arousal and stress. Data analysis will involve correlating the force applied, the path of movement, perceived control ratings, and HRV measures.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that participants who apply greater force to the block will report a higher perceived sense of control.  Furthermore, we expect to observe a positive correlation between force applied and HRV measures indicating increased physiological arousal. The data will provide empirical evidence to support the hypothesis that physical exertion directly impacts the subjective experience of agency and control.  The recording data will provide a detailed, quantitative picture of the force applied during the manipulation.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of varying the intended force on the participant’s subjective experience of the manipulation?

**Methodology:** This investigation will use a randomized between-subjects design. 30 participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: a “Low Force” group (instructed to apply a gentle push), a “Medium Force” group (instructed to apply a moderate push), and a “High Force” group (instructed to apply a forceful push). Each participant will manipulate the block five times. Immediately following each manipulation, participants will complete a short questionnaire assessing their subjective experience. The questionnaire will include questions about the ease of movement, the sense of effort required, and the perceived outcome (successful or unsuccessful manipulation).  Data will be collected using self-report measures and video recordings. Analysis will involve comparing the questionnaire responses and observational data across the three groups, looking for statistically significant differences in subjective experience.

**Expected Outcomes:** We predict that participants in the “High Force” group will report the greatest perceived effort and the most negative subjective experience (e.g., frustration, difficulty). Conversely, participants in the “Low Force” group are expected to report the easiest manipulation and the most positive subjective experience. This study aims to illuminate how external expectations and explicit instructions regarding force influence our subjective interpretation of the manipulation’s outcome.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the accuracy of participants' self-reported control ratings?

**Methodology:** This investigation will employ a mixed-methods approach. Twenty-five participants will be asked to rate their perceived sense of control following each block manipulation. Alongside this subjective assessment, we will simultaneously track physiological data – specifically, heart rate variability (HRV) – using wearable sensors. HRV measures the variation in the time intervals between heartbeats, providing a sensitive indicator of autonomic nervous system activity, which is directly linked to levels of stress and arousal. Following each session, participants will provide a brief written reflection on their experience, describing their sensations and thoughts during the manipulation. These reflections will be analyzed qualitatively, searching for patterns and themes related to the subjective experience.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that the correlation between the participants’ subjective control ratings and HRV measures will be significantly higher than chance. This would provide strong evidence that self-reported control is influenced by physiological factors. Qualitative analysis of the reflection data will reveal the cognitive and emotional factors shaping the participant’s perception of control during the block manipulation, providing a deeper understanding of the subjective experience.  Data analysis will include correlation and thematic analysis.
