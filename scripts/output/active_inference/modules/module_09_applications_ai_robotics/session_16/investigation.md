Okay, let's generate the requested research questions and accompanying documentation, adhering strictly to the specified format and requirements.

## Research Question 1: How does the sensitivity of an ultrasonic sensor’s frequency band affect its ability to accurately detect obstacles of varying sizes?

**Methodology:** This investigation will involve constructing a controlled experimental setup. A robotic platform equipped with an ultrasonic sensor will be programmed to systematically scan a designated test area (approximately 1 meter x 1 meter) containing a series of obstacles of varying sizes (e.g., spherical objects of 10cm, 20cm, 30cm diameters, and a larger 50cm sphere). The sensor’s frequency band will be systematically varied (e.g., 32kHz, 40kHz, 50kHz) using software adjustments.  For each frequency, the sensor will record the distance to each obstacle over a defined number of scans (e.g., 100 scans). The accuracy of distance measurement will be quantified by comparing the sensor's readings to known distances (verified with a calibrated ruler) for each obstacle at each frequency. Statistical analysis (e.g., calculating standard deviation, running a t-test) will be performed to determine the relationship between frequency and accuracy.  Environmental factors (temperature, air currents) will be carefully monitored and controlled. Data logging will be implemented to record all measurements and environmental conditions.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that the accuracy of the ultrasonic sensor’s distance measurements will be frequency-dependent. Specifically, we hypothesize that a frequency range optimized for the typical size of obstacles in the test environment (likely between 32kHz and 40kHz) will yield the most accurate measurements.  We expect to see a decline in accuracy at both lower and higher frequencies due to factors such as signal attenuation and interference. This investigation will provide quantitative data demonstrating the importance of selecting an appropriate frequency band for ultrasonic sensor applications, especially in obstacle detection scenarios. The study will also identify the sensitivity of the sensor to environmental conditions.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of varying the processing speed of a microcontroller on the responsiveness and accuracy of a robot’s obstacle avoidance system?

**Methodology:** This investigation will assess the impact of microcontroller processing speed on a robot’s obstacle avoidance performance. A robotic platform equipped with an ultrasonic sensor and a microcontroller will be utilized. The microcontroller's clock speed will be systematically varied (e.g., 16MHz, 32MHz, 64MHz) through firmware adjustments.  The robot will be programmed to navigate a pre-defined course containing a series of static obstacles.  The robot’s responsiveness (measured as the time taken to detect and react to an obstacle) and accuracy (measured as the distance of closest approach to the obstacle) will be recorded. The robot's actions will be timed using precise timing mechanisms. Data will be recorded continuously during the navigation task. Statistical analysis will be performed to determine the correlation between processing speed and robot performance metrics (reaction time and proximity to obstacles). The experimental setup will be carefully controlled to minimize external variables.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that increasing microcontroller processing speed will lead to improved robot performance – shorter reaction times and closer proximity to obstacles. We anticipate a positive correlation between processing speed and performance. However, we also anticipate a potential "diminishing returns" effect; beyond a certain processing speed, the improvements in performance will become less significant. The study will provide empirical evidence for optimizing microcontroller selection for robotic control systems, considering the trade-off between processing power and the system's response time.  The results will assist in defining appropriate processing requirements for real-time control applications.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the effectiveness of different noise filtering techniques in reducing sensor data inaccuracies when using an ultrasonic sensor?

**Methodology:** This investigation will explore the impact of noise filtering on ultrasonic sensor data. A robotic platform equipped with an ultrasonic sensor will be utilized. The robot will navigate a course with obstacles. Two different noise filtering techniques (e.g., Moving Average filter, Median filter) will be implemented. The sensor’s raw data (distance measurements) and filtered data will be simultaneously recorded during navigation. The effectiveness of the filters will be assessed by comparing the filtered data’s statistical properties (mean, standard deviation) with the raw data's statistical properties. Metrics such as the percentage of measurements that fall within a defined tolerance range will be calculated to quantify filter effectiveness. The experimental setup will be carefully controlled to minimize external variables.  Different filter parameters (window size for Moving Average, number of neighbors for Median) will be systematically varied to observe their impact.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that effective noise filtering will significantly reduce sensor data inaccuracies, particularly those caused by reflections and interference. The study will identify the most suitable noise filtering technique for the given application and demonstrate the importance of parameter selection. The results will provide guidance for selecting appropriate filters to improve the robustness and accuracy of ultrasonic sensors in real-world environments.  This research will contribute to developing reliable sensor systems for autonomous navigation and environmental monitoring.
