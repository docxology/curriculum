**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Which of the following best describes the core concept of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)?
A)  A system for automatically classifying existing data.
B)  A process where two networks compete to generate realistic data.
C)  A method for compressing large datasets into smaller formats.
D)  A technique for debugging software code.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** GANs utilize a generator and discriminator network in a competitive process, mimicking how the brain learns through prediction and refinement of internal models – a key aspect of Active Inference.

**Question 3:**  In the context of Active Inference, what does “predictive coding” primarily refer to?
A)  The process of creating new sensory experiences.
B)  The brain's ability to anticipate future events based on prior beliefs.
C)  The act of consciously planning actions.
D)  The transmission of signals between neurons.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Predictive coding highlights the brain’s constant effort to model the world, predicting sensory input and adjusting beliefs based on discrepancies between predictions and actual experience – foundational to Active Inference.

**Question 4:**  How do GANs relate to the concept of representation learning as described in the lecture?
A)  GANs exclusively focus on pre-engineered feature extraction.
B)  GANs generate representations by competing to create data that resembles real data.
C)  GANs are solely used for analyzing existing data distributions.
D)  GANs operate independently of any underlying model of the world.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** GANs embody representation learning by automatically building internal models through the competitive training of the generator and discriminator, reflecting a learned, probabilistic understanding of the data.

**Question 5:**  What is a key difference between a prokaryotic cell and a eukaryotic cell?
A) Prokaryotic cells are larger and more complex.
B) Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles, while prokaryotic cells do not.
C) Prokaryotic cells have a defined nucleus, while eukaryotic cells do not.
D) Prokaryotic cells utilize DNA for storage.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The defining characteristic is the presence of a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles in eukaryotic cells, differentiating them fundamentally from the simpler, non-membrane-bound structure of prokaryotic cells.

**Question 6:**  Describe one potential real-world application of GANs beyond generating images.?
**Answer:** GANs can be used to generate synthetic medical images for training diagnostic models, create realistic financial data for risk assessment simulations, or generate diverse training data for autonomous vehicles. Key points include their ability to create data that mimics real-world complexity.

**Question 7:** Explain how the discriminator network in a GAN contributes to the learning process.?
**Answer:** The discriminator network critically evaluates the output of the generator, providing feedback that guides the generator to produce increasingly realistic datA) This adversarial process pushes the generator to refine its internal model, mirroring the refinement of predictive models in Active Inference.

**Question 8:**  Discuss a potential challenge associated with using GANs to generate realistic data.?
**Answer:** A significant challenge is ensuring the generated data doesn’t contain unintended biases or artifacts present in the training data, as GANs can sometimes amplify these biases, potentially leading to skewed or misleading results. It is critical to scrutinize the output and validate its generalizability.

**Question 9:**  Considering the concept of “embodied understanding” from Active Inference, how might a robot's sensory input differ from that of a human?
**Answer:** A robot’s vision system, like the discriminator in a GAN, processes raw sensory data and infers meaning (e.g., “apple”) based on its learned model, whereas a human’s perception is likely more holistic and integrated, relying on prior experiences and contextual understanding alongside direct sensory input.

**Question 10:**  Synthesize the principles of both Generative Adversarial Networks and Active Inference – how do they both relate to creating intelligent systems?
**Answer:** Both approaches share a common thread: building internal models of the worlD) GANs achieve this through a competitive learning process, while Active Inference emphasizes the agent’s active pursuit of understanding through predictive coding. Both ultimately aim to create systems capable of anticipating and shaping their environment.
