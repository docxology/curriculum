## Research Question 1: How does the resolution of a GAN’s discriminator network affect the realism of generated images?

Methodology: This investigation will utilize a controlled experiment comparing the performance of three GAN models trained to generate images of faces. Model A will employ a relatively low-resolution discriminator (e.g., 64x64 pixels), Model B will use a medium-resolution discriminator (e.g., 128x128 pixels), and Model C will utilize a high-resolution discriminator (e.g., 256x256 pixels). All three models will be trained on a standard face dataset (e.g., CelebA). We will assess the realism of the generated images using both quantitative metrics (e.g., Fréchet Inception Distance – FID) and qualitative human evaluation. A panel of five human participants will rate the generated images on a scale of 1 to 7, judging factors such as facial detail, texture, and overall visual appeal. Statistical analysis (ANOVA) will be applied to compare the FID scores and human ratings across the three models.

Expected Outcomes: We anticipate that Model C, with the highest discriminator resolution, will demonstrate the lowest FID score, indicating the most realistic generated images.  The human ratings are expected to align with the quantitative results, with Model C receiving the highest average rating. We hypothesize that a higher-resolution discriminator allows for more detailed representation of the learned data distribution, ultimately leading to improved image realism. This will demonstrate the critical influence of the discriminator's resolution on the overall performance of the GAN.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of varying the learning rate during GAN training on image quality?

Methodology: This study will investigate the impact of different learning rates on GAN training. Three GAN models will be trained to generate images of flowers. Model A will use a fixed learning rate of 0.001, Model B will employ a smaller learning rate of 0.0001, and Model C will utilize a larger learning rate of 0.002. All models will be trained on a standard flower dataset. We will monitor the training loss for each model over 100 epochs.  Image quality will be assessed by measuring the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and through visual inspection of the generated images. Furthermore, we will calculate the gradient norm of the discriminator's loss to assess stability. We will perform a power analysis to determine the required sample size to detect a statistically significant difference.

Expected Outcomes: We predict that a moderate learning rate (e.g., 0.001) will result in the fastest convergence and the highest quality generated images. A learning rate that is too high may lead to instability and divergence, while a learning rate that is too low may result in slow convergence and suboptimal image quality. The power analysis will provide a formal justification for the observed differences.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the stability of GAN training with different batch sizes?

Methodology: This investigation will evaluate the effect of batch sizes on GAN training stability. Three GAN models will be trained to generate images of handwritten digits (MNIST dataset). Model A will employ a batch size of 32, Model B will utilize a batch size of 64, and Model C will utilize a batch size of 128.  We will monitor the training loss and the discriminator loss for each model over 50 epochs.  We will also track the gradient norm of the discriminator loss, which is a common metric for assessing training stability. We will perform visual inspection of the generated images to identify any artifacts or distortions. An ANOVA analysis will be performed to compare the variation of the loss values across the models.

Expected Outcomes: We anticipate that larger batch sizes will lead to more stable training, resulting in lower variance in the loss values and fewer training artifacts. However, extremely large batch sizes may also introduce their own challenges, such as increased memory requirements and potential issues with gradient scaling.  The results will offer insight into the trade-offs associated with choosing a batch size for GAN training.
