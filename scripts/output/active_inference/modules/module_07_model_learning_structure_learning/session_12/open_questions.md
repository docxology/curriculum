Okay, here’s the output based on your detailed requirements and formatting specifications.

## Open Question 1: What is the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas13 targeting viral RNA?

Context: CRISPR-Cas13 has emerged as a powerful tool for antiviral immunity. Understanding the precise mechanism by which Cas13 identifies and degrades viral RNA – particularly within infected cells – is crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies. Research continues to focus on the molecular interactions and specificity factors involved.

## Open Question 2: What are the long-term cognitive effects of microglial activation during Alzheimer's disease progression?

Context: Microglial activation plays a central role in the inflammatory processes observed in Alzheimer’s disease.  However, the extent to which chronic microglial activity contributes to long-term cognitive decline – specifically neuronal damage, synaptic loss, and amyloid plaque formation – remains a significant area of research, investigating potential biomarkers and therapeutic interventions.

## Open Question 3:  How can AI-driven simulations accurately predict protein aggregation pathways in neurodegenerative diseases?

Context: Protein aggregation is a hallmark of diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.  Developing robust computational models that can predict and map these complex aggregation pathways – incorporating factors like protein sequence, environment, and cellular interactions – is essential for designing targeted therapies aimed at preventing or reversing the process.  Research is increasingly leveraging machine learning techniques for this purpose.
