Okay, let's craft three research questions with the specified formatting and constraints.

## Research Question 1: The Impact of Social Media Usage on Adolescent Self-Esteem

**Methodology:** This research will employ a quantitative, correlational study. We will administer a survey to 200 adolescents (aged 13-18) recruited from local high schools. The survey will include validated scales measuring social media usage (frequency, platforms used, types of content consumed) and self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale).  Correlation analysis will be used to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between these variables.  We’ll control for demographic variables like age, gender, and socioeconomic status to account for potential confounding factors.  Statistical significance will be assessed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate finding a negative correlation between excessive social media usage and self-esteem. Specifically, we hypothesize that higher levels of social media usage will be associated with lower self-esteem scores.  This research will contribute to understanding the potential detrimental effects of social media on adolescent psychological well-being. The findings will inform discussions about responsible social media consumption and highlight the need for interventions aimed at promoting healthy self-perception.  We expect a statistically significant, albeit potentially moderate, correlation coefficient.

## Research Question 2: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Interventions in Reducing Test Anxiety

**Methodology:** This study will be a quasi-experimental design. 60 undergraduate students enrolled in introductory psychology courses will be randomly assigned to either a treatment group (n=30) or a control group (n=30). The treatment group will participate in an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention, consisting of weekly group sessions led by a qualified instructor. The control group will continue with their regular study habits. Before and after the intervention, both groups will complete the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to measure test anxiety levels.  Additionally, students will complete a self-reported measure of study habits.  An independent samples t-test will be used to compare the change in STAI scores between the two groups.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that the mindfulness-based intervention will significantly reduce test anxiety compared to the control group. We anticipate observing a statistically significant decrease in STAI scores within the treatment group following the intervention. This research will provide evidence for the efficacy of mindfulness techniques as a method for managing stress and improving psychological well-being, particularly in academic settings. We predict a statistically significant p-value (<0.05) indicating a difference in anxiety reduction between the two groups.

## Research Question 3:  Assessing the Correlation Between Sleep Duration and Cognitive Performance in College Students

**Methodology:** This research will utilize a correlational study design involving 100 undergraduate students. Participants will complete a daily sleep diary for one week, recording their bedtime, wake-up time, and estimated sleep duration.  They will also complete a standardized cognitive performance test – the Stroop Test – to measure interference and processing speed.  Data analysis will involve calculating the average sleep duration for each participant and correlating this with their scores on the Stroop Test.  We’ll also control for factors like caffeine consumption and reported stress levels.  Pearson’s correlation coefficient will be calculated to determine the strength and direction of the relationship.

**Expected Outcomes:**  We hypothesize that a positive correlation will be found between average sleep duration and performance on the Stroop Test. Specifically, students who consistently reported longer sleep durations will exhibit better performance on the Stroop test, indicated by a lower interference score and faster processing speed. This research could support the understanding that adequate sleep is crucial for optimal cognitive function.  A statistically significant correlation coefficient is expected, further strengthening the connection between sleep and cognitive abilities.
