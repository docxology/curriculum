## Research Question 1: How does the depth of the convolutional layers in a CNN affect its ability to detect edges in an image?

**Methodology:** This investigation will involve constructing a simplified CNN model with varying numbers of convolutional layers (2, 4, and 6 layers) applied to a standard dataset of grayscale images (e.g., MNIST digits). Each CNN will be trained using stochastic gradient descent with a fixed learning rate. The architecture will consist of a standard setup:  a convolutional layer with 32 filters, a ReLU activation function, and a max-pooling layer after each convolutional stage, culminating in a fully connected layer and a Softmax output layer. We will monitor the accuracy of edge detection using a predefined set of edge maps for each image. The number of epochs will be fixed at 10. The data will be split into training (60%) and validation (40%) sets. We'll calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted edge map and the ground truth. The key dependent variable will be the MSE value.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate a positive correlation between the depth of the convolutional layers and the accuracy of edge detection, up to a certain point. Initially, increasing layer depth will improve the CNN's ability to identify more complex edges due to the increased capacity for feature extraction. However, beyond a certain depth (likely 4-6 layers), the accuracy will plateau or even decrease. This may be due to overfitting to the training data, where the model starts learning noise rather than genuine features. We expect to see a significant reduction in MSE values as the layer depth increases, initially, and a stabilization of the MSE values as layer depth increases beyond a particular point.

## Research Question 2: What is the impact of varying the learning rate on the convergence speed of a deep convolutional neural network?

**Methodology:**  This study will utilize a CNN architecture (similar to the one in Question 1) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We will experiment with three different learning rates: 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001. The CNN will be trained for 50 epochs. Each learning rate will be applied to the same CNN architecture and dataset. We will track the loss (measured using cross-entropy loss) and the accuracy on a held-out validation set during training.  The accuracy will be calculated after each epoch. We will visually plot the loss and accuracy over time for each learning rate.  Statistical analysis (e.g., calculating the standard deviation of the loss across multiple runs with different random initializations) will be used to assess the significance of any observed differences. We’ll examine the rate of decrease in loss and the final value of the loss achieved.

## Research Question 3: How can the use of batch normalization improve the training stability and overall performance of a deep autoencoder?

**Methodology:** We will construct an autoencoder with a standard CNN architecture (based on the initial design in Question 1) and train it using the MNIST dataset. We'll implement batch normalization after each convolutional layer *and* after the fully connected layers. We'll compare this to a control group that does *not* utilize batch normalization. Both groups will be trained for 30 epochs, using the same hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, optimizer, etc.). We’ll track the reconstruction error (Mean Squared Error between the input and reconstructed images) and the training loss during each epoch. We will visually plot the reconstruction error and training loss for both groups. Furthermore, we will examine whether batch normalization reduces the sensitivity of the training process to variations in the input data. We’ll also quantify the improvement in the final Mean Squared Error.
