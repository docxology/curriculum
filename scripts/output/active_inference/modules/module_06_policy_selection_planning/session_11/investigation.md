Okay, here’s the output following all the detailed specifications and format requirements. I’ve aimed for clarity, precision, and strict adherence to the provided guidelines.

## Research Question 1: How does the Discount Factor Influence the Optimal Policy in a Grid World Navigation Task?

Methodology: This research will investigate the impact of the discount factor (γ) – a key parameter in reinforcement learning – on the learned optimal policy for a simulated robot navigating a 10x10 grid world. The grid world will contain a goal state and several obstacles. The robot will be trained using the Q-learning algorithm. The discount factor will be systematically varied across a range of values (0.9, 0.95, 0.99, 0.999) to assess its influence. For each γ value, 1000 episodes of training will be conducted. The Q-values will be updated using the standard Q-learning update rule.  The resulting Q-table will be analyzed to determine the optimal action probabilities at each state. Success will be measured by the average number of steps taken to reach the goal state, as well as the average cumulative reward achieved over the training episodes. A statistical analysis (ANOVA) will be performed to determine if there are significant differences in the performance metrics across the different γ values.  The training environment will be implemented in Python using the NumPy library for efficient array operations.  Visualization tools (Matplotlib) will be used to plot the average steps taken and cumulative rewards as a function of the discount factor.

Expected Outcomes: We anticipate that a higher discount factor (closer to 1.0) will lead to a more exploitative policy, where the agent prioritizes immediate rewards over long-term goals. This will likely result in a shorter path to the goal, but potentially with a lower cumulative reward due to the “shortcut” behavior. Conversely, a lower discount factor (closer to 0.0) will lead to a more conservative, exploration-focused policy, taking longer to reach the goal but potentially achieving a higher cumulative reward by considering long-term consequences. The statistical analysis is expected to reveal a significant correlation between the discount factor and the average steps taken and cumulative rewards. The results will provide a quantitative understanding of the impact of this crucial parameter on learning and policy optimization within reinforcement learning.

## Research Question 2: What is the Effect of Reward Shaping on the Speed of Convergence in a Simulated Robotic Arm Control Task?

Methodology: This research will examine how different reward shaping strategies affect the learning speed of a simulated robotic arm tasked with reaching a target location. The robotic arm will be controlled using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) model, leveraging convolutional layers to process visual input. The environment will consist of a 3D space with a fixed robotic arm and a randomly positioned target. The core investigation involves systematically modifying the reward function to provide more specific guidance. We will implement three distinct reward shaping techniques: (1) Sparse reward (only reward for reaching the goal), (2) Intermediate rewards for proximity to the target, and (3) A reward function that combines both proximity and progress towards the goal. We will train the DQN model with each reward shaping strategy for 5000 episodes. The performance will be measured by the average number of episodes taken to reach the target, and the average cumulative reward achieved during the training process. We'll use adaptive learning rates within the DQN architecture to accelerate convergence. Finally, we will compare the learning curves (average steps taken vs. episodes) and the final trained Q-values across the three reward shaping configurations.

Expected Outcomes: We hypothesize that reward shaping will accelerate learning, particularly when utilizing intermediate rewards for proximity to the target. The presence of proximal rewards should guide the robotic arm towards the goal more efficiently, leading to a faster convergence to the optimal policy. Conversely, relying solely on a sparse reward (only reward at the goal) is predicted to result in slower learning, as the agent would require extensive exploration to discover the optimal path. We anticipate that the optimal reward shaping strategy will demonstrably reduce the number of episodes required to reach the goal, offering insights into effective reward design for accelerating reinforcement learning. We expect to see significant variance in learning speed based on the complexity and structure of the reward shaping implementation.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the Stability of a Q-Learning Policy after Applying Reward Shaping?

Methodology: This investigation focuses on assessing the stability of Q-Learning policies after the application of reward shaping. We will utilize a modified 10x10 grid world environment, similar to the previous research. The core methodology involves training three distinct Q-Learning policies – one with a standard sparse reward (reaching the goal), one with intermediate rewards for proximity to the target, and one with a hybrid reward function combining both. Each policy will undergo 2000 episodes of training. The key measure of stability will be the variance in Q-value estimates across multiple runs (e.g., 10 independent training runs) for each policy. Specifically, we will calculate the standard deviation of the Q-values at each state after a predetermined number of training episodes (e.g., 1000 episodes). We will then analyze the trends in Q-value variance. Furthermore, we’ll monitor the action probabilities—that is, the distribution of actions taken by the robot in each state—across these runs to assess the consistency of the learned policy. A high degree of variance in Q-values across runs would indicate an unstable policy, while a low variance indicates a more robust and reliable learned policy. Finally, we will test the policy under different conditions (e.g., slight changes in the grid world environment) to observe the policy's resilience.

Expected Outcomes: We predict that the policy trained with intermediate rewards will exhibit a lower variance in Q-value estimates compared to the policy trained with only the sparse reward. This suggests that the inclusion of proximal rewards provides greater certainty and reduces the sensitivity of the Q-value estimates to minor changes in the environment or training process. Conversely, the policy trained with only a sparse reward is expected to show a higher variance, indicating that the Q-value estimates are highly influenced by random fluctuations during exploration. This research will provide empirical evidence for understanding the impact of reward shaping on the stability of reinforcement learning policies and the importance of designing stable and reliable learning algorithms.
