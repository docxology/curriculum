## Policy Selection & Planning

**Introduction to Optimal Control Theory:** Optimal control theory provides a rigorous mathematical framework for designing control policies – sequences of control actions – that minimize a cost function associated with a dynamic system. We’ve previously explored various action selection strategies, including rule-based systems and fuzzy logic. However, these approaches often lack the precision and efficiency required for complex systems. Optimal control theory offers a systematic methodology to determine the *best* control strategy, considering the inherent uncertainties and constraints of the system. The core idea is to transform a problem of finding the ‘best’ solution into a calculus problem, allowing us to apply powerful mathematical tools. Consider a simple example: a robot tasked with moving a block to a specific location. A rule-based system might instruct the robot to “move forward until it’s close,” but optimal control would calculate the exact sequence of movements to achieve the goal with minimal energy expenditure and travel time.
