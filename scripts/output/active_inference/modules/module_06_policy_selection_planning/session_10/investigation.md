## Research Question 1: How does the dynamic weighting of energy consumption impact the efficiency of a robotic arm's trajectory planning?

Methodology: This investigation will utilize a simulation environment (e.g., MATLAB or Python with a robotics simulation library like ROS) to model the movement of a robotic arm. We will systematically vary the weighting factor applied to the energy consumption cost function within the trajectory planning algorithm. The algorithm uses the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, iteratively calculating optimal control actions to minimize the Hamiltonian. The simulation will be run for several trajectories of varying lengths and complexities. Key metrics will be recorded: trajectory execution time, total energy consumed, and the distance between the planned and actual trajectory. The simulation will include a varying range of parameters such as arm mass, joint friction, and desired trajectory smoothness.  Statistical analysis (t-tests, ANOVA) will be performed on the collected data to determine the significance of changes in energy consumption as the weighting factor is adjusted. The simulations will be repeated 10 times for each weighting factor to account for stochasticity.

Expected Outcomes: We anticipate a strong positive correlation between the energy consumption cost and the efficiency of the trajectory planning. A higher weighting factor will likely lead to a more conservative trajectory, characterized by slower speeds and longer execution times, but with considerably lower energy consumption. Conversely, a lower weighting factor might yield a faster, more direct trajectory, but at the expense of increased energy usage.  We expect to observe a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) in energy consumption and trajectory time across the tested weighting factor ranges.  The results will provide a quantitative understanding of how optimizing for energy efficiency directly impacts trajectory performance and inform the selection of appropriate weighting factors for various robotic applications. This research will quantify the trade-off between speed and energy efficiency, a crucial element in robotic system design. (187 words)

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of increasing the dimensionality of the state vector on the complexity of optimal control solution?

Methodology:  This investigation will employ a simplified model of a dynamic system – a single-degree-of-freedom mass-spring-damper system – to explore the relationship between state vector dimensionality and the computational complexity of optimal control. The system's equations of motion will be derived and implemented in MATLAB. Initially, the state vector will consist of only position and velocity. Then, we'll add additional state variables (e.g., angular position and angular velocity) to increase the dimensionality to three. The Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle will be applied to calculate the optimal control law for each system. The complexity will be assessed based on the number of iterations required by the algorithm to converge to a solution and the computational resources (CPU time, memory usage) consumed during the solution process.  The same trajectory will be calculated for each state vector size to ensure comparability. We will also analyze the sensitivity of the solution to small changes in the system parameters.

Expected Outcomes: We predict that increasing the dimensionality of the state vector will dramatically increase the computational complexity of the optimal control solution. The algorithm’s convergence rate is expected to decrease, requiring a significantly greater number of iterations to reach a solution. This is due to the increased number of state variables and the resulting complexity of the Hamiltonian and its derivatives. We expect a non-linear correlation between the state vector size and computational time.  We anticipate a significant performance degradation, potentially rendering the solution impractical for complex systems with many degrees of freedom.  The results will demonstrate the scalability challenges of optimal control techniques, highlighting the importance of carefully selecting the appropriate state vector size for specific applications.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the impact of system uncertainty on the robustness of optimal control solutions?

Methodology: This investigation will simulate a linear time-invariant (LTI) system – a simple pendulum – in MATLAB. We will introduce various levels of uncertainty into the system's parameters (e.g., mass, length, friction coefficient).  We will quantify uncertainty by varying these parameters randomly within a predefined range, drawing from a normal distribution. The optimal control solution will be calculated using the Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle. The robustness of the solution will be evaluated by analyzing the sensitivity of the control action and the trajectory tracking performance to these parameter variations. We will generate multiple optimal control solutions for each set of parameter values and calculate the standard deviation of the control actions and trajectory errors. This will assess the level of robustness. We will systematically vary the size of the uncertainty range and the number of simulations conducted to analyze the effect.

Expected Outcomes: We anticipate that increasing the level of system uncertainty will negatively impact the robustness of the optimal control solution. The control actions will become more erratic, and the trajectory tracking performance will deteriorate. The standard deviation of the control actions and the trajectory errors will increase with increasing uncertainty.  We expect to observe a discernible trade-off between the precision of the optimal control solution and its ability to handle uncertainty.  The results will quantify the impact of uncertainty on control design, demonstrating the need for robust control strategies that can effectively mitigate the effects of parameter variations. This research will illustrate the importance of considering uncertainty in real-world robotic systems. (184 words)
