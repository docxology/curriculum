## Lab Focus: Sensory Input

**Module: Introduction to Active Inference – Lab 1: Sensory Input**

**Lab Number:** 1
**Lab Focus:** Sensory Input

**1. Brief Background (87 words)**

This laboratory exercise builds upon the foundational concepts of Active Inference, introduced in the previous lecture. We’ll explore how the brain actively constructs sensory experience by minimizing prediction errors. Traditionally, we’ve considered the brain passively receiving data. However, Active Inference proposes that the brain continuously generates models of the world and adjusts its actions to reduce discrepancies between these models and the actual sensory input it receives. This exercise will demonstrate the crucial role of prior expectations in shaping our perception.

**2. Lab Objectives**

*   Identify how prior expectations influence the interpretation of sensory data.
*   Record observed changes in perception based on manipulated stimuli.
*   Construct a simple generative model relating sensory input and motor output.
*   Differentiate between passive reception and active construction of sensory experience.
*   Collect quantitative data on perceived changes.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   **Stimuli:**
    *   White Noise Generator (capable of producing frequencies from 20Hz – 2000Hz) – Quantity: 1
    *   Colored LED Flashlights (Red, Green, Blue) – Quantity: 3
    *   Small White Card (5cm x 5cm) – Quantity: 1
*   **Data Collection:**
    *   Perception Rating Scale (1-10, 1 = No Change, 10 = Extreme Change) – Quantity: 1
    *   Stopwatch – Quantity: 1
    *   Pen and Paper – Quantity: 1 set per student group (2 students per group)
*   **Other:**
    *   Tables (2 per group)
    *   Measuring tape (1 meter)

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

*   **Laser Hazard:** The LED flashlights project concentrated light. Direct exposure to the eyes can cause temporary or permanent damage. [INSTRUCTOR] – Ensure students maintain a minimum distance of 30cm from the flashlights.
*   **Electrical Safety:** The noise generator operates at low voltage. Do not attempt to modify the unit. [INSTRUCTOR] – Disconnect the unit from the power source before any adjustments.
*   **Eye Strain:**  Prolonged exposure to bright light may cause eye strain. Take frequent breaks. [INSTRUCTOR] – Encourage students to look away from the stimuli every 10 minutes.
*   **Trip Hazard:** Ensure the workspace is clear of obstructions to prevent slips and falls.

**5. Procedure**

1.  **Group Setup:** Divide students into groups of two. Each group will use a table and a white card.
2.  **Baseline Measurement (5 minutes):**  Without any stimuli, have each student independently rate their perception of the ambient sound (using the 1-10 scale) and record the rating.
3.  **White Noise Introduction (10 minutes):** Activate the white noise generator at a moderate volume (approximately 60dB).  Have each student independently rate their perception of the sound (1-10 scale) and record the rating. Note any specific characteristics perceived.
4.  **Color Introduction (10 minutes per color):**
    *   **Red Flashlight:** Position the red flashlight so that it illuminates the white card. Have each student independently rate their perception of the card’s appearance (1-10 scale) and record the rating.
    *   **Green Flashlight:** Repeat the process with the green flashlight.
    *   **Blue Flashlight:** Repeat the process with the blue flashlight.
5.  **Repeat Steps 3 and 4 a second time** (total 20 minutes)
6.  **Debrief:** As a group, discuss the observations and their implications in relation to Active Inference.

**6. Data Collection**

| Subject | Baseline Perception Rating (1-10) | Red Flashlight Rating | Green Flashlight Rating | Blue Flashlight Rating |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Student 1 |  |  |  |  |
| Student 2 |  |  |  |  |

**7. Analysis Questions**

1.  How did the perception rating change when the white noise was introduced? What features of the noise might have influenced this change?
2.  Did the color of the flashlight affect the perceived appearance of the white card? Explain the potential reasons for any observed differences.
3.  How does this exercise illustrate the concept of “prediction error” as described in Active Inference?
4.  Considering your observations, how might the brain actively “shape” our sensory experience?
5.  If you were designing a study to further test this, what additional variables would you manipulate?

**8. Expected Results**

Students should observe that the perception rating increases with the introduction of white noise, reflecting a greater sensitivity to the noise’s presence.  The color of the flashlight should also demonstrably influence the perceived appearance of the white card - for example, the card will likely appear brighter when illuminated with the white flashlight, and potentially have a different perceived hue. This demonstrates that prior expectations (regarding sound and visual appearance) play a critical role in shaping sensory experience, aligning with the core principles of Active Inference. Students will begin to appreciate that the brain doesn't passively record the world, but actively constructs it based on its internal models.
