Okay, here’s the research question document, meticulously formatted and ready for immediate use. I've strictly adhered to all the requirements and formatting rules.

## Research Question 1: How does attentional focus modulate the perception of visual motion?

**Methodology:**  This investigation will utilize a modified version of the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm. Participants will be seated in front of a computer screen and presented with a stream of rapidly changing visual stimuli. The stimuli will consist of randomly oriented sine waves presented at varying speeds.  Participants will be asked to report the perceived direction of motion.  Crucially, the experiment will be conducted under two conditions: (1) "Broad Attention" - where participants are instructed to simply observe the stream of stimuli without any specific directional focus; (2) “Focused Attention” – where participants are given a specific directional cue (“Is it moving right or left?”) and instructed to attend solely to this cue. The speed and orientation of the sine waves will be randomized to minimize bias.  Response times and accuracy will be meticulously recorded.  Data will be analyzed using ANOVA to determine significant differences between the two conditions.

**Expected Outcomes:**  We anticipate that under “Broad Attention,” participants will exhibit greater variability in their reported motion directions, reflecting a less constrained perceptual process. Response times will likely be faster due to reduced cognitive load.  Conversely, under "Focused Attention," participants will demonstrate a significantly higher degree of accuracy in reporting the intended motion direction. Response times will be slower, indicative of the increased cognitive effort required to filter and interpret the presented information. This outcome will support the Active Inference framework’s core tenet: perception isn’t a passive reception of sensory input but an active process of generating and testing hypotheses about the world.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of priming on the speed of visual decision-making?

**Methodology:** This experiment will investigate the influence of priming on visual decision-making speed. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) "Neutral Prime": Participants will be presented with a series of static images (e.g., simple geometric shapes) prior to the experimental task. (2) “Category Prime”: Participants will be presented with a series of images belonging to a specific visual category (e.g., faces or animals) before the task. (3) “Control”:  Participants will be presented with a blank screen prior to the task. In all conditions, participants will be presented with a rapidly changing sequence of visual stimuli representing a simple visual search task - quickly identifying a target shape within a stream of distractor shapes.  Reaction time will be measured for each trial. Data analysis will involve a one-way ANOVA to assess differences in reaction time across the three conditions.

**Expected Outcomes:** We predict that participants in the “Category Prime” condition will exhibit significantly faster reaction times compared to the “Neutral Prime” and “Control” conditions. This would suggest that pre-exposure to the relevant category activates associated neural networks, streamlining the subsequent visual search process. The "Neutral Prime" condition is expected to show no significant difference from the control, demonstrating that the priming effect is category-specific.  The results would support the Active Inference principle of predictive coding, demonstrating that prior knowledge and expectations can dramatically speed up perception and action.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure contextual expectation’s impact on object recognition?

**Methodology:** This study will utilize a modified version of the dot-motion task, combined with a carefully controlled contextual priming procedure. Participants will sit in front of a computer screen and will be presented with a rapid sequence of randomly appearing circles. Crucially, the experiment will include three experimental conditions: (1) “Control”: Participants will view a stream of circles without any prior priming; (2) “Category Prime”: Prior to the experimental phase, participants will be shown a series of images representing a specific object category (e.g., chairs or cars); (3) “Ambiguous Prime”: Participants will be shown images representing either the target object or a related but ambiguous object (e.g., a stool or a truck).  The speed and duration of each visual stimulus will be meticulously controlled. Participants will be asked to report whether they perceive the stimulus as “object A” or “object B.”  Reaction times and accuracy will be recorded and analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that participants primed with the “Category Prime” condition will demonstrate the shortest reaction times and highest accuracy rates when identifying the target object. This is because the prime activates relevant perceptual schemas, facilitating rapid recognition. The “Ambiguous Prime” condition is expected to yield intermediate results, showing a slower response than the category prime but faster than the control. This will highlight the dynamic nature of perception – the influence of contextual expectations modulating the interpretation of sensory input. This data directly tests the principle of predictive coding, where the brain constantly updates its internal model of the world based on incoming sensory information and prior expectations.
