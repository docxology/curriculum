**Question 1:** Which of the following best describes the core concept of Active Inference?
A) The brain passively receives sensory information and creates a static internal model.
B) The brain actively constructs its reality by predicting and minimizing prediction errors.
C) The brain solely relies on pre-existing knowledge to interpret new sensory input.
D) The brain generates random signals that are then interpreted as meaningful experiences.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Active Inference posits that the brain constantly generates models to predict sensory input and adjusts actions to reduce discrepancies between these models and the actual sensory data it receives.

**Question 2:** What is the primary function of a generative model in the context of Active Inference?
A) To store and retrieve specific memories.
B) To passively record and analyze environmental data.
C) To actively predict sensory input and guide motor actions.
D) To simply replicate external stimuli.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Generative models are core to Active Inference, constantly creating predictive models that drive behavior, aiming to reduce prediction errors and shape our perceived reality.

**Question 3:**  How does sensory input relate to the concept of prediction error in Active Inference?
A) Sensory input always perfectly matches pre-existing models, leading to no errors.
B) Prediction errors are irrelevant, as the brain only processes raw sensory data.
C) Prediction errors signal discrepancies between expected and actual sensory input, driving adaptive responses.
D) Sensory input is solely determined by external stimuli, without any internal influence.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:**  Active Inference highlights that prediction errors—the difference between predicted and actual sensory input—are the driving force behind adaptive behavior, motivating the brain to adjust its models.

**Question 4:**  What distinguishes perception from action within the framework of Active Inference?
A) Perception is a passive process, while action is an unconscious reflex.
B) Perception and action are entirely separate processes with no interaction.
C) Perception and action are intertwined, with perception informing action and vice versa.
D) Perception only occurs during sleep, while action only occurs during wakefulness.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Active Inference views perception and action as interdependent, where perceptual models drive motor actions to minimize prediction errors and shape the sensory environment.

**Question 5:**  Which of the following represents a key difference between a passive and an active view of the brain?
A) A passive view suggests the brain is merely a receiver, while an active view suggests it's a constructor.
B) Both views are fundamentally equivalent in their explanations of brain function.
C) Passive models rely on extensive pre-existing knowledge, while active models require constant adaptation.
D) The passive view ignores the influence of prior expectations, while the active view embraces them.
**Answer:** D
**Explanation:** The core distinction lies in the active construction of reality versus passive reception of information; the active view emphasizes the role of expectations in shaping our sensory experience.

**Question 6:**  Briefly describe the role of prior expectations in sensory perception according to Active Inference?
**Answer:** Prior expectations shape our perception by biasing how we interpret incoming sensory datA) The brain doesn't start from a blank slate; instead, it utilizes existing models and assumptions to construct its understanding of the world, influencing how we perceive and react to stimuli.

**Question 7:**  How might the laboratory exercise investigating sensory input relate to the concept of minimizing prediction error?
**Answer:** By manipulating stimuli and observing changes in perception ratings, students can directly see how deviations from expected sensory input (prediction errors) trigger adjustments in the brain's model, ultimately attempting to restore a predicted state.

**Question 8:**  Explain, in your own words, how a generative model could be used to explain someone's perception of a familiar object.?
**Answer:** A generative model for a familiar object would contain a highly refined representation of that object’s appearance, shape, and associated properties. The brain uses this model to continuously predict what the object *should* look like, and when there’s a discrepancy (a prediction error) between the expected and actual appearance, the brain updates the model, refining its understanding.

**Question 9:**  Discuss a potential real-world application of understanding Active Inference, such as robotics or human-computer interaction?
**Answer:** Active Inference principles could be used to design robots that are more adaptable and responsive to changing environments. By equipping robots with predictive models and feedback mechanisms based on prediction errors, they could autonomously navigate complex situations and interact with the world more effectively, similar to how humans learn and adapt.

**Question 10:**  Synthesize the concepts of generative models and prediction error.  How are they interconnected within Active Inference's framework?
**Answer:** Generative models provide the foundation for predicting sensory input, and prediction error represents the discrepancy between these predictions and the actual sensory datA) The continuous process of generating models and detecting/reducing prediction errors is what fundamentally drives behavior in Active Inference, allowing organisms to actively construct and maintain their perceived reality.
