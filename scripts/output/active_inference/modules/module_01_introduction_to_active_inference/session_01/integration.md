**Session Notes: Active Inference – Sensory Perception and Action**

This session’s focus on active inference directly connects to Module 1’s exploration of basic sensory processing, specifically how the brain constructs representations of the external world. The core concept – that perception isn’t a passive reception of signals, but an active process of generating and testing hypotheses – builds substantially upon the foundational ideas presented in Module 2’s discussion of neural networks and hierarchical processing. Furthermore, the emphasis on minimizing prediction error resonates with Module 3’s principles of homeostasis and feedback control, where the body constantly adjusts its internal state to maintain equilibrium.  The laboratory exercise investigating sensory input directly illustrates this principle, showcasing how deviations from predicted sensory input trigger adjustments within the brain’s predictive models.  The iterative process of generating predictions, comparing them to actual sensory input, and updating the model’s representation is a central mechanism for learning and adaptation, mirroring the evolutionary processes described in Module 4 regarding the development of sensory systems.  The ability to proactively shape the environment through action, as predicted by active inference, further highlights the dynamic relationship between the organism and its surroundings – a crucial element in understanding biological systems.
