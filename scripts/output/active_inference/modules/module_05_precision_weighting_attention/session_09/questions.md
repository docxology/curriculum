**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Which of the following best describes the Free Energy Principle?
A) A model predicting external environmental changes.
B) A mechanism for directly controlling cellular processes.
C) A principle stating that all systems minimize their surprise or free energy.
D) A method for instantly repairing damaged DNA.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The Free Energy Principle posits that all systems, from simple to complex, strive to reduce their “surprise” – formally free energy – by constructing internal models that accurately predict sensory input.

**Question 3:** How does selective attention contribute to efficient sensory processing?
A) By increasing the overall level of background noise.
B) By amplifying all sensory stimuli equally.
C) By prioritizing processing of stimuli with the largest changes in the internal model.
D) By completely blocking out irrelevant sensory information.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Attention mechanisms focus on signals that cause the largest changes in the internal model, effectively reducing the ‘surprise’ associated with those signals and improving information processing.

**Question 4:** What is a key difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?
A) Prokaryotic cells are larger and more complex.
B) Eukaryotic cells possess membrane-bound organelles, including a nucleus.
C) Prokaryotic cells perform photosynthesis more efficiently.
D) Eukaryotic cells are found exclusively in animals.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Prokaryotic cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus and other complex organelles, whereas eukaryotic cells contain these structures, leading to greater organizational complexity.

**Question 5:**  The simulation utilizes adjustable attention weights. What is the primary purpose of manipulating these weights?
A) To increase the rate of neural firing across the entire system.
B) To mimic the brain's ability to prioritize relevant sensory information.
C) To completely randomize the system's response to stimuli.
D) To prevent the robot from learning new behaviors.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Adjustable attention weights allow the system to dynamically focus on signals that cause the largest changes in the internal model, mimicking how the brain prioritizes sensory input.

**Question 6:**  Describe, in 2-3 sentences, how a noisy environment impacts the operation of the simulated robot’s attention mechanism.?
**Answer:** The robot’s internal model is disrupted by the ‘surprise’ caused by the noisy environment. Consequently, the system adjusts its attention weights to focus primarily on the sound signal that creates the largest change in its model, effectively minimizing this sensory surprise.

**Question 7:** Explain, in 2-3 sentences, how the principle of ‘free energy minimization’ relates to the robot's response to a sudden, flashing light.?
**Answer:** The sudden light represents an unexpected event, increasing the system’s ‘free energy’. To reduce this surprise, the robot will adjust its attention weights, prioritizing the signal associated with the flash, thereby refining its internal model and improving future sensory predictions.

**Question 8:**  In 2-3 sentences, how does the simulated robot’s behavior demonstrate the concept of selective perception?
**Answer:** The robot doesn't process *all* sensory input equally; instead, it dynamically adjusts its attention weights to emphasize the stimulus causing the greatest change in its internal model. This prioritized processing mirrors biological attention, showcasing the system’s ability to selectively focus on relevant information.

**Question 9:**  Discuss, in 2-3 sentences, a potential real-world application of the principles of precision weighting and attention – consider a scenario involving a self-driving car.?
**Answer:**  A self-driving car utilizes attention mechanisms to prioritize relevant visual data, such as the position of other vehicles and pedestrians. By dynamically adjusting its focus, the car can efficiently process information and make critical decisions, effectively mimicking a biological system’s ability to ‘attend’ to important sensory cues.

**Question 10:**  Synthesize the concepts of ‘free energy minimization’ and ‘selective perception’ – why are both essential for efficient information processing in a biological system (or a simulated robot)?
**Answer:**  Free energy minimization provides the fundamental drive for a system to construct an accurate internal model, while selective perception ensures that the system efficiently processes only the most relevant information, reducing ‘surprise’ and optimizing resource allocation – mirroring the core functionality of biological attention mechanisms.
