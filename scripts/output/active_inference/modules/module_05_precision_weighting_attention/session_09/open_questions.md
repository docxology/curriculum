## Open Question 1: What is the mechanism of predictive coding in the human brain?

Context: Predictive coding is a dominant theory in neuroscience, suggesting the brain doesn’t passively receive sensory information but actively generates models of the world and continuously updates them based on incoming data. Research focuses on understanding how the brain predicts sensory input and identifies discrepancies – “prediction errors” – that drive learning and adaptation. Current research involves fMRI and EEG studies investigating the neural circuits underlying this process, particularly the interaction between cortical areas and the thalamus.

## Open Question 2: How does embodied cognition influence the interpretation of ambiguous visual scenes?

Context: Embodied cognition proposes that cognitive processes are fundamentally shaped by our physical interactions with the environment.  Research in this area examines how our sensory-motor experiences – including our movements, spatial awareness, and physical embodiment – influence how we perceive, interpret, and make sense of ambiguous visual stimuli. Recent studies are using virtual reality and robotics to manipulate environmental factors and observe how this alters perceptual judgments.

## Open Question 3: What are the implications of integrated information theory for consciousness research?

Context: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) posits that consciousness is fundamentally related to the amount of integrated information a system possesses—i.e., how much it is a unified, irreducible whole.  IIT offers a quantifiable measure of consciousness, and is currently being tested through neural correlates of consciousness research, particularly within the context of anesthesia studies and examining the altered states of consciousness. It's a controversial theory, but is generating novel approaches for defining and measuring subjective experience.
