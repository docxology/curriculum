## Research Question 1: How Does Prioritization Affect Model Accuracy in a Simulated Stock Market?

**Methodology:** This investigation will simulate a stock market environment using Python. The model will be built around a Bayesian approach, initially assigning a prior weighting to various market indicators (e.g., price-to-earnings ratio, trading volume, news sentiment).  The model will then update these weights based on new market data – simulated daily stock prices. We will run the simulation with varying levels of “prior knowledge” – essentially, different levels of initial weighting assigned to specific indicators.  Specifically, we will have three levels: (1) “Naive Prior” - equal weighting to all indicators, (2) “Expert Prior” - heavy weighting to indicators identified by a finance expert as being highly predictive, and (3) “Random Prior” - equally random weighting across indicators. The simulation will run for 100 days. Model accuracy will be measured as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the predicted stock price and the actual stock price.  Statistical analysis will be performed on the MAPE results to determine if there are significant differences between the three approaches.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that the “Expert Prior” will achieve the lowest MAPE, suggesting that incorporating expert knowledge into the initial weighting scheme improves predictive accuracy. We expect the “Naive Prior” to have the highest MAPE, indicating that without any prior knowledge, the model performs poorly. The “Random Prior” is expected to perform somewhere in between. This investigation provides empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of Bayesian approaches in model building, emphasizing the importance of incorporating domain expertise to refine initial parameter estimates.  Furthermore, it serves as a proof-of-concept for dynamically adjusting model parameters based on available data.

## Research Question 2: What is the Effect of Data Quality on Model Performance in a Customer Churn Prediction System?

**Methodology:** This study will investigate the impact of data quality issues – specifically, missing values and outliers – on the accuracy of a customer churn prediction system. We will develop a machine learning model (using logistic regression) to predict customer churn based on a dataset of customer attributes (e.g., tenure, monthly charges, usage data).  We will artificially introduce different levels of data quality problems into the dataset. Specifically, we will create three levels: (1) “Clean Data” – data with no missing values or outliers, (2) “Moderate Noise” – data with 10% missing values and a small number of outliers, and (3) “High Noise” – data with 30% missing values and a substantial number of outliers. The model will be trained and evaluated on each dataset. Performance will be measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) will be used to determine if there are significant differences in performance across the three datasets.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that the “Clean Data” dataset will yield the highest model performance metrics, demonstrating the ideal scenario for accurate predictions. The “Moderate Noise” dataset will likely result in a moderate decrease in accuracy due to the influence of errors in the data. Finally, we expect the “High Noise” dataset to produce the poorest results, highlighting the vulnerability of machine learning models to data quality issues. This research underscores the crucial role of data cleansing and preprocessing in building robust and reliable predictive models.

## Research Question 3: How Can We Measure the Impact of Dynamic Weighting on Model Convergence in a Fraud Detection System?

**Methodology:** This investigation will focus on assessing the convergence speed of a machine learning model – an artificial neural network – when utilizing dynamic weighting versus a static weighting scheme in a simulated fraud detection system.  The system simulates fraudulent transactions based on various factors (e.g., transaction amount, location, time of day). The model learns to identify fraudulent transactions. We will test two approaches: (1) “Static Weighting” -  the same weight is assigned to each feature at all times, and (2) “Dynamic Weighting” - weights are adjusted based on the model’s performance (e.g., using a reinforcement learning algorithm, reward is given when correct classification and punishment for incorrect). The model’s convergence rate will be measured by the number of epochs required to achieve a predetermined accuracy threshold.  Furthermore, we will track the model’s predictive performance over time.  Statistical analysis, including ANOVA, will be applied to analyze the results.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that the “Dynamic Weighting” model will demonstrate faster convergence compared to the “Static Weighting” model, suggesting that the algorithm adapts more efficiently to the underlying data distribution. The “Static Weighting” model will likely require significantly more epochs to reach the same accuracy level.  This research provides insight into effective model training strategies, highlighting the benefits of adapting learning parameters based on real-time model feedback.
