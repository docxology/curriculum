## Research Question 1: How Does the Choice of Prior Distribution Impact the Convergence Rate of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)?

Methodology: This investigation will systematically explore the influence of different prior distributions on the convergence rate of a VAE trained on the MNIST dataset. We will train three VAE models: one with a Gaussian prior (mean 0, standard deviation 1), one with a Laplacian prior (scale parameter 1), and one with a uniform prior (range -1 to 1).  For each model, we will monitor the ELBO (Evidence Lower Bound) over 1000 training iterations.  The ELBO will be recorded at 100-iteration intervals.  We will use the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.  We’ll implement a standard VAE architecture with two fully connected layers and a sigmoid activation for the output.  We’ll use Python with TensorFlow/Keras. Key metrics tracked will be convergence rate (number of iterations to reach a stable ELBO), and the final ELBO value.  Statistical analysis, including t-tests, will be used to compare the convergence rates and final ELBO values across the three models. This will allow us to determine if specific priors lead to faster or more stable learning.

Expected Outcomes: We anticipate that the Gaussian prior will likely exhibit the fastest convergence rate due to its smoothness, allowing the VAE to quickly learn a well-defined latent space.  The Laplacian prior, with its heavier tails, may converge more slowly but potentially capture more complex patterns in the data.  The uniform prior is expected to converge the slowest, indicating the challenges of learning from a relatively unstructured prior. We expect to observe a strong correlation between the prior’s shape and the speed of convergence.  A report detailing these findings, including visualizations of the ELBO over time for each model, will be produced.

## Research Question 2: What is the Effect of Varying the Number of Latent Units on the Quality of Generated Images with a Variational Autoencoder?

Methodology: This research will evaluate how the number of latent units in a VAE impacts the quality of images generated by the model. We will train VAEs with varying numbers of latent units: 64, 128, 256, and 512. For each model, the MNIST dataset will be used. The architecture will remain consistent across all models. We will measure image quality using two metrics: the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and visual inspection. The FID score quantifies the distance between the distribution of generated images and the distribution of real images. We’ll also conduct a subjective visual assessment by having three independent reviewers rate the quality of the generated images on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent). A learning rate of 0.001 and the Adam optimizer will be utilized.  The model will be trained for 5000 iterations, with the FID score calculated every 500 iterations.

Expected Outcomes: We hypothesize that an increasing number of latent units will initially improve image quality, allowing for finer-grained control over the generated images. However, beyond a certain point, adding more units will introduce noise and divergence, ultimately degrading image quality as measured by both the FID score and subjective evaluation. We expect to identify a “sweet spot” – an optimal number of latent units that balances complexity and quality. The findings will be documented in a report with quantitative (FID scores, convergence rate) and qualitative (visual examples) analyses.

## Research Question 3: How Can We Measure the Variance of the Latent Space in a Variational Autoencoder Trained on the Fashion-MNIST Dataset?

Methodology: This investigation will examine the variance of the latent space of a VAE trained on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. We will train a VAE with the standard architecture (64 latent units, Adam optimizer, 5000 iterations) and record the variance of the latent space at regular intervals (every 500 iterations) for the first 1000 iterations. The Fashion-MNIST dataset is chosen for its inherent visual complexity. We will monitor the variance of the latent space and record it alongside the ELBO. The ELBO will be used to track the learning process and potentially identify stages where the latent space is becoming well-defined.  We’ll analyze how the variance changes over time and relate it to the shape of the ELBO curve.  This will provide insights into the quality of the latent representation learned by the VAE.

Expected Outcomes:  We anticipate observing a gradual increase in the latent space variance as the VAE learns. Initially, the variance will likely be low, reflecting a poorly-defined latent space.  As training progresses, the variance will increase, indicating that the VAE is becoming more capable of capturing the diversity in the Fashion-MNIST dataset.  We will analyze the relationship between the variance and the ELBO – anticipating a negative correlation.  A comprehensive report including visualizations (variance over time) and statistical analysis, will be produced to quantify the relationship and provide insights into the latent space structure.
