## Open Question 1: What is the Mechanism of Diffusion Magnetic Resonance (Diffusion-MRI) Signal Enhancement?

Context: Diffusion-MRI is a powerful tool for tissue characterization, particularly in neurological disorders. However, its signal can be weak, especially in white matter. Researchers are actively exploring methods to enhance this signal. Understanding *how* these enhancement techniques work – specifically, the physics behind the signal amplification – is crucial for developing more effective protocols and interpreting results accurately. This question probes the core of the technique’s success, exploring the biophysical principles.

## Open Question 2: What is the Impact of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on Multi-Modal Medical Image Analysis?

Context: Integrating diverse data types – such as MRI, PET, and CT – is increasingly vital in medical diagnosis.  However, traditional machine learning struggles with these heterogeneous data sources. Graph Neural Networks offer a promising solution by explicitly representing relationships between anatomical regions.  This question investigates the potential of GNNs to overcome limitations within multi-modal medical imaging, focusing on the advancements being made in the field of biomedical informatics and computer vision.

## Open Question 3: What are the Implications of Federated Learning for Patient Data Privacy?

Context: The exponential growth of healthcare data presents significant privacy challenges. Traditional centralized data collection raises concerns about data breaches and unauthorized access. Federated Learning offers a decentralized alternative, enabling model training without direct data sharing. However, ensuring true privacy – including robustness against adversarial attacks – remains a central research question. This question investigates the critical considerations surrounding data protection within the evolving landscape of healthcare AI.
