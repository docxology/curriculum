## Research Question 1: The Impact of Sleep Duration on Cognitive Performance

**Methodology:** This research investigates the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive performance, specifically focusing on attention and memory tasks. We will recruit 30 undergraduate students with self-reported regular sleep schedules. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: a short sleep group (4-5 hours), a moderate sleep group (7-8 hours), and a long sleep group (9-10 hours).  Each participant will complete a series of standardized cognitive tests at baseline and again after a 24-hour period. These tests will include the Stroop task (measuring attention) and the digit span test (assessing working memory). Data will be analyzed using ANOVA to determine if there are significant differences in performance between the groups.  Control variables (age, gender, general cognitive ability) will be carefully monitored and accounted for during the analysis.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that the moderate sleep group (7-8 hours) will demonstrate the highest scores on both the Stroop task and the digit span test, indicating optimal cognitive performance. The short sleep group is expected to show impaired attention and memory, while the long sleep group might exhibit slight performance decrement.  This research will provide quantitative evidence for the optimal sleep duration needed for maximal cognitive function.

## Research Question 2: The Correlation Between Social Media Usage and Reported Levels of Anxiety

**Methodology:** This research will examine the association between the frequency and type of social media usage and reported levels of anxiety. We will administer a survey to 150 participants (aged 18-25) assessing their social media usage patterns (platforms used, time spent, types of content engaged with) and utilizing a validated anxiety scale (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale – GAD-7). Data will be analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficients to determine the strength and direction of the relationships between various social media variables (e.g., time spent on Instagram vs. GAD-7 scores) and regression analysis to control for potential confounding factors like age, gender and self-reported social support.

**Expected Outcomes:**  We predict a positive correlation between the amount of time spent on visually-oriented social media platforms (e.g., Instagram, TikTok) and reported anxiety levels. We anticipate that frequent engagement with content related to social comparison, beauty standards, or negative news will amplify this effect.  The results will contribute to a better understanding of the potential links between social media use and mental well-being, informing strategies for responsible social media consumption.

## Research Question 3: Assessing the Effectiveness of Mindfulness Meditation on Stress Reduction

**Methodology:** This study will investigate the efficacy of a brief mindfulness meditation intervention on self-reported stress levels. 60 participants experiencing moderate levels of stress (as assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale - PSS) will be randomly assigned to either a mindfulness meditation group (30 minutes of guided meditation) or a control group (30 minutes of quiet reading). Participants will complete the PSS at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and again one week later. Data will be analyzed using paired t-tests to compare changes in PSS scores between the two groups.  Potential confounding variables such as prior meditation experience and baseline stress levels will be accounted for in the analysis.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that the mindfulness meditation group will demonstrate a significant reduction in their PSS scores compared to the control group. This suggests that even a short mindfulness meditation session can effectively decrease perceived stress. The findings will support the use of mindfulness techniques as a simple, accessible tool for managing stress and improving mental health.
