## Course Description

A comprehensive exploration of Active Inference, a unifying theoretical framework that explains how biological systems 
(from single cells to complex organisms) maintain their structural and functional integrity through perception, action, 
and learning. This course covers the mathematical foundations of variational inference and Bayesian mechanics, the 
hierarchical generative models that enable predictive processing, and the active inference formulation of perception 
as inference and action as minimizing expected free energy. Students will learn how this framework integrates perception, 
action, attention, and learning into a single principled account, with applications spanning neuroscience, cognitive 
science, artificial intelligence, robotics, and clinical psychology. The course examines how organisms minimize surprise 
(or maximize model evidence) through both perceptual inference (updating beliefs about the world) and active inference 
(sampling data that confirms predictions), leading to adaptive behavior and self-organization. Topics include the 
mathematical formulation of variational free energy, the role of generative models and their hierarchical structure, 
precision weighting and attention, policy selection and planning, model learning and structure learning, and the 
relationship between active inference and other frameworks such as predictive processing, reinforcement learning, 
and optimal control theory. The course also explores empirical evidence from neuroscience, computational implementations, 
and practical applications in AI systems, autonomous agents, and therapeutic interventions.


## Additional Constraints

Emphasize the mathematical rigor while maintaining accessibility through intuitive explanations and concrete examples. 
Include computational exercises and implementations. Connect theoretical principles to empirical findings in neuroscience 
and applications in AI/robotics. Address both the philosophical implications (e.g., embodied cognition, the nature of 
agency) and practical applications (e.g., clinical interventions, autonomous systems design).
