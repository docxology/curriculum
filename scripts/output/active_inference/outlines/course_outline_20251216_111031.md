## Course Description

This course comprehensively covers everything you ever wanted to know (and a lot you didn't know you wanted to know) about tree grafting. History, Biology, Sociology, Esoteric, deep lore, practical hands on, agro-economic and culture, all aspects completely covering what the tree grafter of today and tomorrow would be best apt to know today.

## Additional Constraints

Course is for very motivated tree grafters, we have access to internet, all modern technologies, and a variety of kinds of trees and people who need tree-related services.
