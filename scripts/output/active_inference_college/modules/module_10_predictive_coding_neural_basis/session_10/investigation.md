Okay, here’s the completed set of research questions, formatted according to the specifications, with the content tailored to fit the 150-200 word target length.

## Research Question 1: How Does Temporal Precision in Motor Control Affect Reaction Time?

**Methodology:** This investigation will utilize a reaction time paradigm with participants performing a simple key-press response task. Participants will be divided into two groups: a “precise” group and a “standard” group. The “precise” group will receive auditory cues (tone bursts) precisely timed to the onset of the target stimulus (e.g., a visual flash), while the “standard” group will receive the visual flash without auditory cues. Reaction times will be recorded for a set number of trials under both conditions. Data analysis will include calculating average reaction times and standard deviations for each group.  Furthermore, EEG (electroencephalography) data will be collected during the task to measure event-related potentials (ERPs) – specifically, the N1 and P3 components, known to be associated with attention and processing speed.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that the “precise” group, receiving the temporally precise cues, will exhibit significantly faster reaction times compared to the “standard” group. This difference is anticipated to be reflected in the ERP data, with larger and more pronounced N1 and P3 components in the precise group, suggesting heightened attentional processing.  The results would support the predictive coding model, illustrating how temporally precise information influences motor control and speeds up reaction times. We also expect variations in the timing of the event-related potentials to demonstrate the precise group’s neurological processing.

## Research Question 2: What is the Effect of Varying Levels of Sensory Noise on the Accuracy of Visual Pattern Recognition?

**Methodology:** Participants will be presented with a series of visual patterns (e.g., simple geometric shapes) displayed on a computer screen.  We’ll create three experimental conditions: a “control” condition with no added noise, a “low noise” condition involving subtle visual static, and a “high noise” condition featuring significant visual distortions. Participants will be asked to identify the patterns as quickly and accurately as possible.  Accuracy will be measured as the percentage of correctly identified patterns, and reaction time will also be recorded for each trial.  Data will be collected under controlled lighting and viewing distance to minimize confounding variables.  Statistical analysis (ANOVA) will be used to compare performance across the three conditions.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that performance (both accuracy and reaction time) will decrease as the level of sensory noise increases. Specifically, the “high noise” condition will result in the lowest accuracy rates and longest reaction times, demonstrating a detrimental impact on visual processing. This finding supports the idea that the brain actively filters out irrelevant sensory information, and that excessive noise disrupts this filtering process, hindering performance.

## Research Question 3: How Can We Measure the Time Course of Neural Activity During a Novel Motor Skill Acquisition?

**Methodology:** Participants will learn to perform a new motor skill – such as tracing a complex shape – through repeated practice sessions. During each session, EEG data will be continuously recorded using an electrode cap. The EEG data will be segmented into time windows (e.g., 1-second intervals) and analyzed to identify changes in neural activity. Specifically, we’ll examine changes in power spectral density (PSD) – a measure of the distribution of frequencies – within different frequency bands (e.g., alpha, beta, gamma). We'll correlate these changes in PSD with the participant’s performance level (measured by accuracy and speed).  Data will be analyzed using time-frequency analysis techniques to identify the specific time periods associated with learning and skill refinement.

**Expected Outcomes:** We predict that initial learning will be associated with a burst of high-frequency activity (gamma band) in the sensorimotor cortex, reflecting the initial formation of neural connections. As the skill becomes more established, we expect to see a shift towards lower-frequency activity (beta band) and a decrease in the overall amplitude of these signals. This temporal pattern of neural activity will demonstrate how learning unfolds over time and how changes in neural activity are correlated with improved motor control.
