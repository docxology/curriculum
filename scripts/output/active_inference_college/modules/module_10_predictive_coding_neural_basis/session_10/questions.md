**Question 1:** Which of the following best describes the core principle of predictive coding?
A)  Sensory input is passively received and processed.
B)  The brain actively generates predictions and compares them to sensory data.
C)  Neurons only transmit signals when stimulated by external stimuli?
D)  The brain relies solely on past experiences to interpret new information?
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Predictive coding posits that the brain constantly creates models of the world and adjusts those models based on ongoing sensory input, minimizing prediction error—a fundamental aspect of this process.

**Question 2:** What is the primary function of the Golgi apparatus within a cell?
A)  Synthesizing proteins
B)  Packaging and modifying proteins for transport
C)  Generating energy through cellular respiration
D)  Storing genetic information in the form of DNA?
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The Golgi apparatus processes and packages proteins and lipids, modifying them and directing them to their final destinations within or outside the cell—crucial for cellular function.

**Question 3:**  Which of the following scenarios best illustrates a hierarchical prediction in the brain?
A)  A dog barking in response to a stranger approaching the house.
B)  A person feeling pain after touching a hot stove.
C)  A child recognizing a familiar face based on subtle features.
D)  A plant growing towards a source of sunlight.
**Answer:** D
**Explanation:** Hierarchical predictions involve a higher-level representation (sunlight) influencing a lower-level representation (plant growth), demonstrating how the brain organizes and refines its understanding of the world.

**Question 4:**  What is the role of ribosomes in protein synthesis?
A)  Transcribing DNA into mRNA
B)  Translating mRNA into a polypeptide chain
C)  Storing RNA molecules within the nucleus
D)  Breaking down excess proteins into amino acids?
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mRNA sequences into functional proteins—a vital process for cell survival and function.

**Question 5:**  Which of the following is a key component of the encoder-decoder model?
A)  A passive sensory receptor constantly receiving information.
B)  An iterative process of generating predictions and updating internal models.
C)  A single, static representation of the external world.
D)  Complete isolation from any external sensory input.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The encoder-decoder model relies on a continuous feedback loop where the encoder generates predictions, the decoder compares them to sensory input, and the error signal adjusts the encoder's future predictions.

**Question 6:**  Describe the relationship between synaptic pruning and neural development?
**Answer:** Synaptic pruning is the process of eliminating unused synapses, primarily during early childhooD) This process, driven by Hebbian learning ("neurons that fire together, wire together"), allows the brain to refine its neural networks, increasing efficiency and specialization. It’s a key mechanism for sculpting the brain’s structure and function.

**Question 7:**  Explain how the double pendulum experiment illustrates hierarchical prediction.?
**Answer:** The double pendulum demonstrates hierarchical prediction because the pendulum’s movement is influenced by its previous state. The lower-level motion (the swing of one pendulum) constrains and predicts the higher-level motion of the other, mirroring how the brain integrates information from different levels to form a coherent representation of its surroundings.

**Question 8:**  Discuss a potential real-world application of understanding predictive coding.?
**Answer:** Predictive coding has significant applications in robotics and artificial intelligence. By implementing predictive models, robots can anticipate movements, react more quickly, and operate in complex environments more effectively. This approach allows machines to move beyond simply responding to sensory input and instead proactively shape their behavior.

**Question 9:**  Considering the concepts of prediction error and feedback loops, how might predictive coding explain human motor control?
**Answer:** Predictive coding suggests that our motor movements aren't solely determined by conscious intention. Instead, the brain constantly predicts the consequences of our actions, and any discrepancies (prediction errors) drive corrective movements. This ongoing loop enables smooth, accurate movements without requiring explicit, detailed commands for every action.

**Question 10:**  Summarize the core differences between a prokaryotic cell and a eukaryotic cell in a single paragraph?
**Answer:** Prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria, lack a membrane-bound nucleus and other complex organelles, representing a simpler cell structure. Conversely, eukaryotic cells, found in plants, animals, and fungi, possess a membrane-bound nucleus and a variety of organelles, allowing for greater cellular complexity and specialization – a fundamental distinction in cell biology.
