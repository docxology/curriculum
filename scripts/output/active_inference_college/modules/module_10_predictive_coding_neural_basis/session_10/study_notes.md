## Predictive Coding – Neural Basis

**Introduction**

Welcome back to Predictive Coding – Neural Basis. In our previous sessions, we’ve established the core principles of predictive coding: the brain isn’t passively receiving information from the world; instead, it’s constantly generating predictions about that world and comparing those predictions to incoming sensory data. This ongoing process, driven by minimizing “prediction error,” is fundamental to how we perceive and interact with our environment. We’ve explored the concept of hierarchical predictions – how the brain organizes information into increasingly complex levels of abstraction. Today, we delve deeper into one of the most influential models for understanding this process: the Encoder-Decoder model. This model provides a concrete framework for thinking about how the brain generates and updates its internal representations. Consider it a neural analogue to a sophisticated feedback loop, constantly refining its understanding based on its predictions.

**Key Concepts**

**Prediction Error**: Prediction error represents the discrepancy between a neural population’s prediction and the actual sensory input it receives. This difference drives the refinement of internal models and representations within the predictive coding system.

**Hierarchical Predictions**: The brain organizes information into increasingly complex levels of abstraction, with each level generating predictions about the level below it. This allows for efficient processing of sensory information by building upon prior knowledge and reducing the overall complexity of the data.

**Encoder-Decoder Model**: This model posits that the brain operates through an iterative cycle of encoding sensory input into predictions and then decoding those predictions against incoming data, generating and resolving prediction errors.

**Prediction Error Minimization**: The fundamental goal of the predictive coding system is to minimize prediction error. This is achieved through continuous adjustments to internal representations, leading to a more accurate and stable model of the world.

**Internal Models**: Predictive coding relies on the creation and maintenance of internal models of the world. These models are constantly updated based on incoming sensory data and prediction errors.

**Feedback Loop**: The encoder-decoder system operates as a feedback loop, where the output of the decoder (prediction error) feeds back to the encoder, influencing subsequent predictions. This iterative process is crucial for learning and adaptation.

**Recurrent Processing**: The continuous flow of information within the encoder-decoder system is recurrent, meaning that signals are constantly re-circulated, allowing for sustained processing and refinement of internal representations.

**Error Signals**: These represent the difference between the brain’s predicted sensory input and the actual sensory input. They are the driving force behind the adjustment of internal models.

**Temporal Coding**: Predictive coding frequently utilizes temporal coding – encoding information not just in the strength of a signal, but also in its timing, which can be vital for rapid responses and contextual understanding.

**Concept Name**: Error Signals : Error signals are the fundamental units of information within the predictive coding system. They quantify the difference between a neural population's prediction of sensory input and the actual input it receives.  These differences drive the adjustment of internal models, leading to a more accurate representation of the world.  Essentially, a large error signal indicates a significant mismatch, prompting the system to alter its predictions to better align with reality.

**Elaboration**

The encoder-decoder model isn't just a theoretical construct; it reflects observed patterns in neural activity. For instance, cortical neurons often exhibit bursting activity, and the timing of these bursts can be directly related to prediction error signals. Furthermore, research in sensory systems like the visual cortex has provided strong support for the model’s underlying principles. Understanding this model is key to unlocking how the brain creates our experience of the world.
