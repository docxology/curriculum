## Lab 1: Sample Space – Exploring Probabilities

**Brief Background:** (98 words)
This laboratory exercise builds upon the foundational concepts presented in today’s lecture regarding probability. We will explore the fundamental idea of a sample space – the set of all possible outcomes for a random event. Understanding sample spaces is crucial for calculating probabilities and forming the basis of Bayesian reasoning. Through hands-on experimentation with a simple coin flip, you will develop a concrete intuition for how probabilities are defined and how they relate to the different outcomes within a sample space.  The exercise emphasizes that probability is not about predicting a single outcome, but about the relative likelihood of various possibilities.

**Lab Objectives:**

*   Identify the sample space for a given event.
*   Calculate the probability of a single outcome within a sample space.
*   Determine the total number of outcomes in a sample space.
*   Understand the relationship between sample space and probability distribution.

**Materials and Equipment:**

*   Fair Coin (1)
*   Six-Sided Die (1)
*   Data Collection Sheet (provided – see Data Collection section below)
*   Pen/Pencil
*   Stopwatch (optional, for timed events)

**Safety Considerations:** (⚠️)

*   **No hazardous materials are involved** in this exercise.
*   **Eye Protection:** Wear safety goggles at all times during the coin flip experiment to prevent accidental eye contact with the coin.
*   **Cleanliness:** Ensure the work area is clean and free from obstructions.
*   **Time Sensitivity:**  None.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Coin Flip Experiment:** Place the coin on a flat surface. Flip the coin 30 times. Record the results (Heads or Tails) in the Data Collection Sheet.
2.  **Die Roll Experiment:** Roll the die 60 times. Record the results (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) in the Data Collection Sheet.
3.  **Analysis:** After completing the trials, calculate the frequency of each outcome for both the coin and the die.

**Data Collection:**

| Experiment | Trial | Outcome | Frequency (Number of Times Observed) |
| :--------- | :---- | :------- | :------------------------------------ |
| Coin Flip  | 1      | Heads    |                                       |
| Coin Flip  | 2      | Tails    |                                       |
| …         | …     | …       | …                                     |
| …         | …     | …       | …                                     |
| Coin Flip  | 30     | …       | …                                     |
| Die Roll   | 1      | 1        |                                       |
| Die Roll   | 2      | 2        |                                       |
| …         | …     | …       | …                                     |
| Die Roll   | 6      | 6        |                                       |

**Analysis Questions:**

1.  For the coin flip experiment, what was the probability of getting heads? Calculate the probability based on your observed data.
2.  For the die roll experiment, what was the probability of rolling a 3?  Calculate the probability based on your observed data.
3.  Considering the total number of trials for each experiment, how does the observed frequency of an outcome relate to the probability of that outcome?
4.  What does it mean for a probability to be ‘close’ to 0.5 for the coin flip, and what does it signify about the fairness of the coin?
5.  How does the concept of sample space influence our interpretation of the experimental results?

**Expected Results:**

Students should observe that the observed frequencies of outcomes in both the coin and die experiments will vary slightly from theoretical probabilities. The frequency of Heads should be approximately 50% for the coin flip experiment (given a truly fair coin). For the die roll, the observed frequency of each number should be approximately equal, reflecting the fact that all six sides are equally likely. This demonstrates the link between experimental data and probability calculations within a sample space. The observed variation in frequency is expected and fundamental to the concept of random events. [INSTRUCTOR] - Adjust the number of trials (30/60) as needed for time constraints.
