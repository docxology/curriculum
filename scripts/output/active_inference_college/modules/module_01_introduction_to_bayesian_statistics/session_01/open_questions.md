## Open Question 1: What is the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas13 for targeted RNA degradation?

Context: CRISPR-Cas13 has emerged as a powerful tool for RNA editing and degradation. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underpinning its target specificity and efficiency remain incompletely understood. Researchers are actively investigating the dynamics of the Cas13 protein-RNA interaction and the role of PAM sequences in guiding target recognition.  Further elucidating these details is crucial for optimizing its therapeutic potential. Current research focuses on characterizing the conformational changes within the Cas13 protein during RNA binding and exploring the influence of RNA secondary structure on target recognition.

## Open Question 2: How does the gut microbiome influence the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy?

Context: The gut microbiome's impact on the immune system is increasingly recognized. Evidence suggests that the composition of the gut microbiome can dramatically affect the response to cancer immunotherapies, particularly checkpoint inhibitors.  Researchers are investigating the specific bacterial species that modulate immune cell activity, influence inflammatory responses, and potentially suppress immune checkpoint signaling. Understanding these complex interactions is pivotal for personalized immunotherapy strategies and predicting treatment outcomes. Current research involves fecal microbiome transplantation studies and metabolomic analyses to identify key microbial metabolites involved in modulating immune cell function.

## Open Question 3: What are the implications of dark matter’s gravitational influence on galactic structure?

Context: Despite comprising approximately 85% of the universe's mass, dark matter remains largely invisible and its nature is unknown.  Its gravitational influence is nonetheless evident in the rotation curves of galaxies and the formation of large-scale structures.  Determining the precise nature of dark matter—whether it's Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), axions, or something entirely new—is a central goal in modern cosmology. Current research employs advanced simulations and astronomical observations to refine our understanding of dark matter’s distribution and impact on galactic evolution, seeking to test and refine theories of structure formation.
