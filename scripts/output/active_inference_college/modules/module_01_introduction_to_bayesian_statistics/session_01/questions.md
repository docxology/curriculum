**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Which of the following best describes a probability distribution?
A) A single, certain outcome
B) A range of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities
C) The absence of uncertainty in a random event
D) A mathematical model predicting the future
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** A probability distribution shows all possible outcomes of a random event, along with the likelihood of each occurring. This allows for quantification of uncertainty and informed decision-making.

**Question 3:**  If you roll a fair six-sided die, what is the probability of rolling a 4?
A) 1/3
B) 1/2
C) 1/6
D) 1
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:**  A fair six-sided die has six equally likely outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The probability of rolling a 4 is 1 out of 6, representing a specific outcome within the sample space.

**Question 4:** What is the key difference between a sample space and a probability?
A) A sample space is a measure of certainty, while probability measures uncertainty.
B) A sample space describes all possible outcomes, while probability assigns a numerical value to each.
C) They are entirely interchangeable terms describing random events.
D) Probability is a physical object, while the sample space is a mathematical concept.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The sample space lists all potential outcomes of an event, while probability calculates the likelihood of each outcome occurring within that sample space.  This distinction is fundamental to statistical reasoning.

**Question 5:**  Which of the following represents the concept of marginalization in Bayesian statistics?
A) Combining prior and posterior distributions
B) Focusing solely on the most likely outcome
C) Calculating the probability of a single variable, disregarding other variables
D) Updating beliefs based on new evidence
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Marginalization involves calculating the probability of a variable given the values of other variables by integrating out the other variables from the joint probability distribution. This simplifies analysis and focuses on specific relationships.

**Question 6:**  Describe the relationship between a sample space and the concept of randomness?
**Answer:** A sample space represents all possible outcomes of a random event. Randomness implies that each outcome within the sample space has an associated probability, and in the absence of knowledge, each outcome is equally likely. This relationship allows us to quantify uncertainty and make probabilistic predictions.

**Question 7:**  Explain how flipping a fair coin demonstrates a fundamental principle of probability?
**Answer:** Flipping a fair coin showcases the concept of equally likely outcomes. There are two possibilities – heads or tails – and each has a probability of 0.5. This illustrates how probabilities are based on the equal likelihood of different events occurring within a defined sample space, irrespective of our subjective beliefs.

**Question 8:**  Discuss the potential applications of understanding sample spaces in real-world scenarios, providing at least one specific example.?
**Answer:** Understanding sample spaces is crucial in quality control (e.g., manufacturing). By analyzing the sample space of defects in a product batch, manufacturers can determine the probability of a product failing and implement strategies to reduce the likelihood of defects. This allows them to manage risk and ensure product quality.

**Question 9:**  How does the concept of marginalization contribute to updating our beliefs in Bayesian inference?
**Answer:** Marginalization allows us to move from a joint probability distribution to a simpler distribution for a single variable, providing a crucial step in updating our beliefs. By calculating the probability of a specific variable, we can combine this with our prior beliefs to form a posterior distribution, reflecting the most updated understanding of the situation.

**Question 10:**  Explain, in your own words, why understanding probability distributions is important in making informed decisions under uncertainty.?
**Answer:**  Probability distributions provide a framework for quantifying the likelihood of different outcomes when dealing with uncertainty. This allows us to assess risks, compare different options, and make decisions based on the most reasonable estimates of potential outcomes, rather than relying on intuition or guesswork.
