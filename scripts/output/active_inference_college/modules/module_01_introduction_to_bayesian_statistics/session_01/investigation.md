## Research Question 1: How does the frequency of social media use correlate with reported levels of anxiety in young adults?

**Methodology:** This investigation will employ a quantitative research design utilizing a survey method.  A sample of 100 young adults (aged 18-25) will be recruited through university channels and online advertising. Participants will complete an online survey assessing their social media usage habits (frequency of use across platforms, time spent per day, types of content consumed) using a validated scale (e.g., Social Media Usage Questionnaire). Simultaneously, they will complete a standardized anxiety scale (e.g., Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale - GAD-7) to measure their levels of anxiety. Data will be analyzed using correlation and regression analysis to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between social media usage patterns and anxiety scores. Ethical considerations, including informed consent and data anonymization, will be strictly adhered to.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate finding a positive correlation between the frequency of social media use and reported anxiety levels. Specifically, higher usage frequency and increased time spent on social media platforms are expected to be associated with higher anxiety scores.  The regression analysis will allow us to quantify the strength of this relationship and potentially identify specific social media activities (e.g., exposure to curated content, social comparison) that are most strongly linked to anxiety.  A non-significant correlation would suggest a more complex relationship or that other factors are more dominant.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of exposure to minimalist design principles on consumer purchasing decisions?

**Methodology:** This research will utilize a controlled experimental design.  Participants (n=75) will be recruited through online advertising and randomly assigned to one of three groups: a Minimalist Design Group (experiencing a product presented with a simple, uncluttered design), a Traditional Design Group (the same product presented with standard marketing aesthetics), and a Control Group (presented with a neutral product image).  After exposure to their respective product representations, participants will be asked to evaluate the product based on factors such as perceived value, desirability, and intention to purchase, using a standardized questionnaire.  Quantitative data will be analyzed using ANOVA to compare the groups’ responses. Qualitative data gathered through post-exposure interviews will provide deeper insights into participants’ motivations and cognitive processes.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that the Minimalist Design Group will exhibit a significantly higher intention to purchase the product compared to the other two groups. We anticipate that participants exposed to the minimalist design will report a greater perceived value and find the product more aesthetically pleasing. This result stems from the theoretical basis of cognitive fluency – simpler designs are easier to process, leading to positive evaluations. A control group comparison will establish the statistical significance of the minimalist design effect.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the effectiveness of targeted advertising campaigns across multiple social media platforms?

**Methodology:** This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data collection techniques. A sample of 150 consumers will be recruited to participate in a simulated advertising campaign. Participants will be exposed to four distinct advertising campaigns (A, B, C, D), each tailored to a different demographic segment (age, gender, interests) and utilizing varied creative approaches (video, image, text). Following exposure, participants will complete a survey assessing their recall of the advertisements, their brand perception, and their purchase intent.  Additionally, a subset of participants (n=30) will be interviewed to provide rich qualitative data concerning their responses to the advertisements, including what resonated with them and what did not.  Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as click-through rates, conversion rates, and social media engagement will be tracked for each campaign.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that campaign B (using a targeted approach and a relatable message) will demonstrate the highest levels of engagement and conversion rates. Quantitative analysis will identify the most effective marketing channels and creative elements. Qualitative data will reveal the underlying drivers of consumer behavior, helping to understand why certain campaigns were more successful than others. The combination of quantitative and qualitative findings will provide a holistic assessment of campaign effectiveness, informing future marketing strategies.
