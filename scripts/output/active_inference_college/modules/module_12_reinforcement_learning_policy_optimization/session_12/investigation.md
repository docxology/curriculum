## Research Question 1: How do varying discount factors (γ) influence the speed and stability of learning in a reinforcement learning agent navigating a simple grid world environment?

Methodology: This investigation will implement a reinforcement learning agent (Q-learning algorithm) within a 10x10 grid world environment. The agent’s goal is to reach a designated target location. The environment includes obstacles and a reward system (positive for reaching the target, negative for collisions). We will systematically vary the discount factor (γ) across a range of values (e.g., 0.9, 0.95, 0.99, 0.5, 0.1). For each γ, the Q-learning agent will be run for a fixed number of episodes (e.g., 1000).  The primary metrics tracked will be: (1) average number of episodes to reach the target, (2) the final Q-values for each state, and (3) the convergence of the Q-values over time.  We will visualize these data using line graphs to observe trends.  Statistical analysis (e.g., ANOVA) may be employed to determine the significance of differences in performance across the different γ values. The grid world will be carefully designed to present a moderately challenging learning task.

Expected Outcomes: We anticipate that a higher discount factor (γ close to 1) will lead to faster initial learning due to the agent assigning higher value to future rewards. However, this may also lead to instability and oscillations in the Q-values. A lower discount factor (γ close to 0) will result in slower learning, as the agent focuses primarily on immediate rewards. We expect that a γ value around 0.95 will strike a balance between speed and stability, exhibiting the most consistent and efficient learning. The analysis will provide empirical evidence supporting the theoretical understanding of γ's role in reinforcement learning, demonstrating how it directly impacts the agent's decision-making process and the convergence of the learning algorithm.

## Research Question 2: What is the impact of increasing the exploration rate (ε) on the agent’s ability to discover the optimal policy in a maze environment?

Methodology: This investigation will employ a Q-learning agent to solve a maze environment (e.g., a 15x15 maze with a known solution path). The agent’s exploration strategy will be governed by a decaying ε value (ε initially set high, gradually decreasing over time).  The Q-learning algorithm will be implemented with a fixed learning rate (α) and discount factor (γ). The primary data collected will be the number of episodes required to reach the target state and the final Q-values for each state. We will run multiple trials for each ε value (e.g., ε = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) to account for the stochastic nature of the environment. The visual representation of the maze will be clearly defined, and the agent’s path will be tracked throughout each episode.

Expected Outcomes: We hypothesize that a higher initial ε (exploration rate) will enable the agent to quickly explore the entire maze, even if it initially leads to suboptimal choices. This exploration will eventually lead to the discovery of the optimal path. Conversely, a lower ε (exploration rate) will constrain the agent's exploration, potentially leading to getting trapped in local optima or never finding the true solution.  We expect a gradual increase in ε over time to be most effective, allowing for initial broad exploration followed by more focused exploitation of learned information.  The results will illustrate the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning, demonstrating the importance of dynamically adjusting the exploration rate to achieve optimal performance.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the impact of the learning rate (α) on the speed and accuracy of learning a policy in a simulated stock trading environment?

Methodology: This research investigates the effect of the learning rate (α) on a reinforcement learning agent’s performance within a simulated stock trading environment. The agent will utilize a Q-learning algorithm to make trading decisions (buy, sell, hold) based on historical stock data. The simulated environment will feature a single stock, and the agent’s goal is to maximize profit over a specified period. The agent’s actions will be constrained by a fixed budget. We will systematically vary the learning rate (α) across a range of values (e.g., 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001) and run numerous trials for each α value. Key metrics to be tracked include: (1) the cumulative profit earned by the agent, (2) the average return on investment, and (3) the stability of the Q-values over time.  Data visualization will be employed to illustrate the relationship between α and the agent’s performance. We will use a historical stock dataset (e.g., Apple stock data) to create a realistic environment.

Expected Outcomes: We predict that a higher learning rate (α) will accelerate the initial learning process, allowing the agent to quickly identify profitable trading patterns. However, excessively high values of α may cause the agent to oscillate between buying and selling frequently, resulting in reduced overall profitability due to transaction costs. Conversely, a lower learning rate (α) will lead to slower but potentially more stable learning, potentially leading to a more durable and profitable trading strategy over the long term. The experiment will illuminate the critical role of the learning rate in the Q-learning algorithm, demonstrating its impact on convergence and overall investment returns.
