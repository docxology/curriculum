**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Explain the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?
**Answer:** Prokaryotic cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles, while eukaryotic cells have both. Prokaryotes are generally smaller and simpler in structure.

**Question 3:**  Which of the following best describes the concept of ‘vanishing gradients’ in neural networks?
A) The activation functions produce extremely sharp gradients during training.
B) Neurons gradually lose their sensitivity to changes in input.
C) The network consistently outputs perfect predictions.
D)  The network's weights are constantly adjusted to optimize performance.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Vanishing gradients occur when gradients become increasingly small as they propagate backwards through the network during training, hindering learning in earlier layers. This is common with deep networks and certain activation functions.

**Question 4:**  What is the key benefit of using recurrent networks for modeling sequential data?
A) They only process data in a single direction.
B) They can maintain a memory of past inputs and dependencies.
C)  They are inherently more computationally efficient than feedforward networks.
D)  They are primarily used for image recognition tasks.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** RNNs possess feedback loops enabling them to maintain a “memory” of prior inputs, making them well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies and sequential patterns within data.

**Question 5:**  In the context of generative models, what does “latent space” refer to?
A) The physical space where the model’s components are located.
B)  A compressed representation of the data in a lower-dimensional space.
C) The dataset used to train the generative model.
D)  The visual output generated by the model.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Latent space is a lower-dimensional representation learned by the model, capturing the underlying structure and relationships within the data, allowing for meaningful data generation.

**Question 6:**  What is the primary purpose of training a generative adversarial network (GAN)?
A) To identify and classify existing data.
B) To learn a probability distribution of the training data.
C) To directly predict the next input in a sequence.
D) To optimize a single network's parameters for a specific task.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** GANs train two networks – a generator and a discriminator – in competition, ultimately learning the underlying probability distribution of the data to generate new samples.

**Question 7:**  Describe, in brief, how RNNs handle variable-length sequences?
**Answer:** RNNs utilize a “hidden state” that is updated at each time step based on the current input and the previous hidden state. This allows them to process sequences of any length, effectively capturing temporal dependencies within the sequence.

**Question 8:**  What is the role of the “teacher forcing” technique during RNN training?
**Answer:** Teacher forcing provides the RNN with the *correct* previous hidden state as input at each step during training, improving training speed and stability by guiding the network’s learning process more effectively.

**Question 9:**  Explain how hierarchical generative models contribute to more realistic outputs compared to single-level models?
**Answer:** Hierarchical models capture complex relationships by building representations at multiple levels of abstraction. This allows the model to generate outputs that reflect a deeper understanding of the data’s underlying structure and dependencies, resulting in more coherent and nuanced outputs.

**Question 10:** Why is it important to visualize the output of a recurrent neural network during training?
**Answer:** Visualization helps to understand the model's ability to retain and utilize context, identify potential issues like vanishing gradients, and assess the quality of generated sequences.
