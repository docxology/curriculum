**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** What distinguishes a biased sample from an unbiased sample?
A) A sample containing only one type of data.
B) A sample reflecting the population's true proportions.
C) A sample where the probability of selection is equal for all individuals.
D) A sample that generates misleading results.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** An unbiased sample accurately represents the population, while a biased sample systematically over- or under-represents certain groups, leading to skewed results.

**Question 3:** What is the significance of a p-value in statistical hypothesis testing?
A) It represents the probability that the null hypothesis is true.
B) It represents the probability of observing the sample data if the null hypothesis is true.
C) It directly measures the effect size of the observed difference.
D) It indicates the level of confidence in the statistical analysis.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The p-value assesses the evidence against the null hypothesis; a smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence against it, though it doesn’t confirm the alternative hypothesis.

**Question 4:** Which of the following best describes the chain rule in probability?
A)  It's a method for calculating the probability of a single event.
B)  It’s a rule for calculating the probability of the intersection of two or more events.
C)  It's used to determine the likelihood of an event occurring in the future.
D)  It relates to the concept of conditional independence.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The chain rule (or multiplication rule) allows you to calculate the joint probability of multiple events by multiplying their individual probabilities, representing the simultaneous occurrence of each.

**Question 5:**  What is the primary purpose of a null hypothesis in statistical testing?
A) To confirm the existence of a specific effect.
B) To provide a framework for testing a specific claim or assumption.
C) To represent the true population parameter.
D) To ensure the statistical test is perfectly accurate.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The null hypothesis is a statement of "no effect" that we attempt to disprove using statistical evidence, forming the foundation for hypothesis testing.

**Question 6:**  Describe the difference between an independent event and a dependent event?
**Answer:** Independent events are those where the outcome of one event does not influence the probability of the other occurring. Dependent events, conversely, are affected by one another; knowing the outcome of one event changes the probability of the other.  For example, flipping a fair coin twice demonstrates independence, whereas drawing two cards without replacement from a deck impacts the probabilities.

**Question 7:** Explain how Bayes' Theorem can be used to update your beliefs about a hypothesis given new evidence?
**Answer:** Bayes’ Theorem allows for updating our beliefs about a hypothesis based on observed datA) The theorem calculates the probability of the hypothesis being true *after* considering the evidence, incorporating prior beliefs (prior probability) and the likelihood of the observed data given the hypothesis. This provides a more refined assessment compared to relying solely on prior assumptions.

**Question 8:**  Imagine a diagnostic test for a rare disease. The test has a 99% accuracy rate (correctly identifies those with the disease and correctly identifies those without). If 1% of the population has the disease, what is the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the disease?
**Answer:** The probability is approximately 14%, calculated using Bayes' Theorem. A positive test result is more likely to indicate the disease when it is rare, because the prior probability of having the disease is low and the test has a high positive predictive value.

**Question 9:**  A researcher is studying the relationship between smoking and lung cancer.  What type of statistical test would be most appropriate to determine if there is a significant association between these two variables?
**Answer:** A chi-square test of independence would be appropriate. This test analyzes the observed frequencies in a contingency table to determine if there is a statistically significant association between the two categorical variables (smoking status and lung cancer diagnosis).

**Question 10:** Explain the concept of “conditional independence” in probability.?
**Answer:** Two events are conditionally independent if knowing one event occurs doesn't change the probability of the other occurring, *given* that another event has already occurreD) For example, rolling a six-sided die twice – the outcome of the first roll doesn't influence the probability of the second roll; they are conditionally independent.
