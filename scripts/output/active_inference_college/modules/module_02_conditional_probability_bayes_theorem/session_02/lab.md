## Module: Conditional Probability & Bayes’ Theorem – Lab 2

**Lab Number:** 2
**Lab Focus:** Chain Rule

**1. Brief Background (98 words)**

This laboratory exercise builds upon the concepts of probability and joint probability introduced in the previous lecture. We’ve established how to calculate the likelihood of multiple events occurring simultaneously. Today, we’re exploring conditional probability – a powerful tool for updating our beliefs based on new evidence. The conditional probability, P(A|B), allows us to determine the probability of event *A* occurring *given* that event *B* has already occurred. We'll utilize this concept within the context of a simulated diagnostic test, mirroring real-world scenarios involving uncertainty and evidence evaluation, directly applying the chain rule for calculating probabilities.

**2. Lab Objectives (4 bullet points)**

*   Calculate the conditional probability P(A|B) using the formula P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B).
*   Determine the joint probability of events A and B occurring.
*   Identify the influence of P(B) on the conditional probability P(A|B).
*   Practice applying the chain rule to solve probability problems.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   **Dice:** 2 standard six-sided dice (Quantity: 2)
*   **Card Stock:**  Colored card stock (Red, Blue, Green) – (Quantity: 30 cards per color = 90 cards total)
*   **Marker Pens:** Black permanent marker pens (Quantity: 20)
*   **Worksheets:** Printed worksheets (Quantity: 20)
*   **Calculator:** Basic scientific calculator (Quantity: 1 per group)
*   **Ruler:** For measuring card dimensions (Quantity: 1 per group)

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

*   **Sharp Objects:**  The marker pens can cause minor skin irritation. Avoid direct contact with eyes. If contact occurs, flush with water for 15 minutes. [INSTRUCTOR] - Demonstrate proper marker handling.
*   **Surface Contamination:**  Work surfaces should be cleaned with disinfectant wipes after completion of the experiment.  [INSTRUCTOR] –  Ensure adequate ventilation.
*   **Time-Sensitive Step (10 minutes):**  All data collection and calculations must be completed within 10 minutes to maintain accurate timing and focus. [INSTRUCTOR] -  Remind students of the time constraint.

**5. Procedure (7 steps)**

1.  **Setup:** Divide students into groups of 2-3. Each group receives 2 dice, a worksheet, and a marker pen. (Time: 2 minutes)
2.  **Event Definition:** Define two events, A and B, using the dice. For example: A = “Sum of the dice is 7”, and B = “At least one die shows a 6”. [INSTRUCTOR] – Provide sample event definitions to students.
3.  **Trial Execution:** Each group performs 20 trials. For each trial, roll the two dice and record the outcome.  (Time: 5 minutes)
4.  **Data Recording:** On the worksheet, record the outcome of each trial as "A" (event A occurs), "B" (event B occurs), or "AB" (both events A and B occur). (Time: 3 minutes)
5.  **Calculating P(A ∩ B):** Determine the number of trials where *both* A and B occurred. This is P(A ∩ B). (Time: 2 minutes)
6.  **Calculating P(B):** Determine the total number of trials. This is P(B). (Time: 2 minutes)
7.  **Calculating P(A|B):** Calculate P(A|B) using the formula: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B).  Record your answer on the worksheet. (Time: 3 minutes)

**6. Data Collection**

| Trial Number | Dice Roll (e.g., 3, 5) | Outcome |
|--------------|-----------------------|---------|
| 1            |                       |         |
| 2            |                       |         |
| …            |                       |         |
| 20           |                       |         |
| **Total Trials**|                       |         |

**7. Analysis Questions (5 questions)**

1.  What is the value of P(A ∩ B) from your data? Explain your reasoning.
2.  What is the value of P(B) from your data? Explain your reasoning.
3.  Calculate the value of P(A|B) based on your data.
4.  How does the value of P(B) influence the calculated value of P(A|B)? Describe the relationship.
5.  If the events A and B were independent, what would be the expected value of P(A|B)? How does this compare to your experimental result?

**8. Expected Results (Student Observation)**

Students should observe that the value of P(A|B) will likely be greater than P(A) (the probability of event A occurring without any prior knowledge) and less than 1. This demonstrates the impact of evidence (B) on updating beliefs about event A. Students will observe that P(A|B) is not necessarily equal to P(A) when P(B) > 0, illustrating the core concept of conditional probability. Specifically, the value of P(A|B) will be influenced by the frequency with which both events A and B occur together.
