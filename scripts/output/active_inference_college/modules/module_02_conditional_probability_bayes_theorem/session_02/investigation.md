Okay, let's craft the three research questions and their accompanying descriptions, adhering strictly to the provided format and requirements.

## Research Question 1: The Impact of Social Media Usage on Adolescent Self-Esteem

**Methodology:** This research will employ a mixed-methods approach. Initially, a quantitative survey will be distributed to 200 adolescents (ages 13-18) recruited from local high schools. The survey will assess social media usage patterns (frequency, platforms used, types of content consumed) and utilize validated scales measuring self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale). Correlation analysis will be performed to determine the relationship between social media usage and self-esteem scores. Subsequently, a small qualitative component will be included – semi-structured interviews with 10 participants selected from the survey group – to explore their experiences and perceptions of social media's influence on their self-worth.  The interviews will provide richer context to the quantitative findings.  Ethical considerations, including informed consent and anonymity, will be paramount throughout the study.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate finding a moderate negative correlation between high levels of social media usage and self-esteem scores. The qualitative data is expected to reveal specific themes, such as social comparison, fear of missing out (FOMO), and cyberbullying, as contributing factors to the observed relationship.  The research will provide statistically significant correlations and detailed accounts of adolescent perceptions concerning social media's effects, contributing valuable insights for educators and parents regarding responsible social media use.

## Research Question 2:  Analyzing the Effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Interventions on Reducing Test Anxiety

**Methodology:** This research will conduct a controlled, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 60 undergraduate students enrolled in introductory psychology courses. Participants will be randomly assigned to either an intervention group (n=30) or a control group (n=30). The intervention group will participate in an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program, utilizing guided meditations and relaxation techniques. The control group will receive standard study materials and a relaxation exercise. Pre- and post-intervention anxiety levels will be measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Statistical analysis will involve comparing the changes in STAI scores between the two groups, using a t-test to determine significant differences. The study will include detailed monitoring of participant engagement and adherence to the intervention protocol. (167 words)

## Research Question 3: Investigating the Relationship Between Sleep Duration and Cognitive Performance

**Methodology:** This research will investigate the association between sleep duration and cognitive performance among 40 college students. Participants will be recruited through university advertisements and will complete a baseline questionnaire assessing their sleep habits (using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index – PSQI) and demographics.  Over a two-week period, participants will maintain a detailed sleep diary to record their sleep duration and quality. Following this, participants will complete a standardized cognitive assessment battery that includes tests of attention (Stroop task), working memory (N-back task), and executive function (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test).  Correlational analysis will be used to examine the relationship between sleep duration and performance on each cognitive task.  Controlling for potential confounding variables, such as caffeine consumption and stress levels, will be included in the analysis.  (178 words)
