## Research Question 1: How does the Temperature of a Simulated Weather System Influence the Variational Free Energy Calculation?

**Methodology:** To investigate this, we will conduct a series of simulations of a simplified weather model – one that predicts temperature and humidity based on initial conditions. We will systematically vary the initial temperature input, ranging from -10°C to 30°C in 5°C increments. For each initial temperature, we will run the simulation for 24 hours and record the predicted temperature and humidity at hourly intervals. Simultaneously, we’ll calculate the Variational Free Energy (VFE) using a standard Bayesian optimization algorithm. The VFE will be defined as the negative log-likelihood of the observed data, given the predicted weather model. This allows us to quantify the “surprise” or misfit between the model's predictions and the actual observed weather.  We will use a Gaussian process as the surrogate model within the VFE calculation. Statistical analysis of the VFE values across the temperature range will then be performed.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that the VFE will initially decrease as the temperature approaches the initial simulated temperature, representing a good match between the model and the observed data. However, as the temperature deviates further from the initial simulated temperature, the VFE will increase, indicating a growing "surprise" or misfit.  We expect a non-linear relationship between temperature deviation and VFE, suggesting that the model’s performance degrades more rapidly as it moves further away from the initial conditions.  This will provide a quantifiable relationship between input temperature and the model's ability to accurately predict weather.

## Research Question 2: What is the Effect of Varying the Initial Humidity on the Accuracy of the Weather Prediction Model?

**Methodology:**  This investigation will replicate the previous study but with a focus on humidity. We’ll conduct simulations using the same weather model but systematically altering the initial humidity input, spanning from 20% to 90% relative humidity in 10% increments. For each humidity level, we’ll run simulations for 24 hours and record the predicted temperature and humidity at hourly intervals.  Crucially, we’ll track the Variational Free Energy (VFE) calculation. The VFE will again be defined as the negative log-likelihood of the observed data given the weather model.  We’ll employ a Gaussian process regression as the surrogate model within the VFE calculations, to assess the sensitivity of the model to this parameter.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that the VFE will demonstrate a similar trend to the temperature experiment, initially decreasing as humidity approaches the initial value and then increasing as the deviation grows. We expect a non-linear relationship between humidity deviation and VFE. This will provide valuable insights into the model’s sensitivity to humidity and highlight whether it performs better at certain humidity levels, potentially indicating biases or limitations within the model's representation of atmospheric processes.

## Research Question 3: How Can We Measure the Model’s Performance Across Diverse Initial Conditions?

**Methodology:**  To comprehensively assess the model's robustness, we will run the weather simulation across a much wider range of initial conditions than the previous experiments. This will involve generating 1000 unique combinations of initial temperature and humidity, drawing from the ranges previously explored ( -10°C to 30°C and 20% to 90% relative humidity, respectively). For each of these conditions, the model will run for 24 hours, and the Variational Free Energy (VFE) will be calculated. This will allow us to generate a statistical distribution of VFE values and characterize the model's uncertainty across the full parameter space. A sensitivity analysis will be performed to identify which initial parameters have the most significant influence on the VFE.

**Expected Outcomes:**  By analyzing the distribution of VFE values, we anticipate identifying the parameter ranges where the model exhibits the lowest uncertainty. This will provide a quantitative assessment of the model's robustness and highlight the areas where further refinement or more comprehensive data are needed to improve its predictive accuracy. The analysis will allow us to determine the limits of the model's applicability and identify the conditions under which it is most reliable.
