## Open Question 1: What is the mechanism of cellular senescence and its role in age-related diseases?
Context: Cellular senescence, a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest, is increasingly recognized as a significant contributor to age-related pathologies. Research is focused on understanding the complex signaling pathways involved – including SASP (Senescence-Associated Secreted Phenotype) – and its influence on chronic inflammation, tissue dysfunction, and cancer development. Current research utilizes single-cell RNA sequencing and CRISPR-based gene editing to dissect these processes at a molecular level.

## Open Question 2: How does the gut microbiome influence the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy?
Context: The gut microbiome has emerged as a critical regulator of immune responses, particularly in the context of cancer immunotherapy. Studies show a clear correlation between specific microbial compositions and the success or failure of checkpoint blockade therapies (e.g., anti-PD-1). Current research employs advanced microbiome sequencing and transplantation experiments to investigate these interactions and identify microbiome-based interventions to enhance immunotherapy outcomes.

## Open Question 3: What are the implications of engineered exosomes for targeted drug delivery and diagnostics?
Context: Exosomes, nanoscale vesicles secreted by cells, are rapidly gaining attention as versatile tools in biomedicine. Researchers are developing methods to engineer exosomes to specifically deliver therapeutic cargo – such as drugs or RNA – to target cells while also utilizing them as biosensors for disease diagnostics. Current research involves manipulating exosome biogenesis and surface markers for enhanced precision and application in personalized medicine.
