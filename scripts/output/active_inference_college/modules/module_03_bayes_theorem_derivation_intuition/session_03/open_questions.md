## Open Question 1: What is the precise mechanism underlying the observed transient amplification of microglial activation following SARS-CoV-2 infection in the aging brain?

Context: Research is increasingly highlighting the role of neuroinflammation in long COVID symptoms, particularly cognitive impairment.  Understanding the initial trigger for this amplification in the elderly, whose immune systems are naturally less robust, is critical for developing targeted therapeutic interventions. Current research focuses on identifying specific signaling pathways.

## Open Question 2: How do circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) influence the polarization of macrophages towards an M2 phenotype in the context of osteoarthritis cartilage degradation?

Context: Osteoarthritis is a chronic inflammatory condition driven by the complex interplay of immune cells and cartilage degradation. MSC-derived EVs are being investigated as potential therapies. Determining whether these EVs directly modulate macrophage polarization, impacting the inflammatory response and progression of disease, is a key research priority. Current studies involve in vitro and in vivo models.

## Open Question 3: What are the long-term implications of engineered CRISPR-Cas9 based interventions for silencing the *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* genes within somatic cells to mitigate the risk of inherited breast and ovarian cancers in individuals with high-risk mutations?

Context: Gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, present a transformative approach for preventing genetic diseases. Assessing the durability and potential off-target effects of such interventions, specifically in cancer prevention, is paramount. Current research involves animal models and examines potential immune responses, as well as the long-term impact on cellular function.
