**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Explain the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?
**Answer:** Prokaryotic cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles, while eukaryotic cells have both. Prokaryotes are generally smaller and simpler in structure.

**Question 3:**  What is the significance of the prior probability in Bayes’ Theorem?
A) It represents the observed data.
B) It’s a measure of the likelihood of the event occurring.
C) It represents our initial belief about the event *before* considering new evidence?
D) It’s calculated after observing the data.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The prior probability reflects our initial belief about the event’s likelihood, established before incorporating any new information. This value is updated through the theorem’s process.

**Question 4:**  If P(A|B) = 0.6 and P(B) = 0.4, what is P(A|B)?
A) 0.2
B) 0.6
C) 1.0
D) 0.8
**Answer:** D
**Explanation:** Using the conditional probability formula, P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B).  While we don't know P(A ∩ B), the given values allow us to deduce that 0.6 is the correct answer.

**Question 5:**  What does the term “evidence” refer to in the context of Bayes’ Theorem?
A) The prior probability
B) The observed data
C) The posterior probability
D) The probability of event A
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** “Evidence” refers to the new data we observe, which is used to update our prior belief and derive the posterior probability. It’s the input that drives the Bayesian inference.

**Question 6:**  A doctor suspects a patient has a rare disease. The disease affects 1 in 10,000 people. The test for the disease has a 99% accuracy rate (99% chance of returning positive when the patient has the disease, and 99% chance of returning negative when the patient doesn't have the disease). The patient tests positive. What is the probability the patient *actually* has the disease?
**Answer:** Approximately 16%. (This is an approximate calculation and a more detailed calculation would yield a closer approximation. It’s a question to assess understanding of applying Bayes’ Theorem.)

**Question 7:**  Explain how Bayes’ Theorem can be used to refine a scientific hypothesis?
**Answer:** Bayes’ Theorem allows scientists to incorporate observed data into their existing hypotheses, updating the probability of the hypothesis being true. This iterative process leads to a more robust understanding, reflecting the influence of the evidence.

**Question 8:**  Describe the role of the posterior probability in the Bayesian inference process?
**Answer:** The posterior probability represents the updated belief about an event after considering both prior probabilities and observed evidence. It’s the outcome of Bayes’ Theorem.

**Question 9:**  How does the concept of “conditional independence” relate to Bayes’ Theorem?
**Answer:**  If events A and B are conditionally independent given event C, it simplifies the calculation of P(A|B) to P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). This highlights a key dependency that can be leveraged in the theorem.
