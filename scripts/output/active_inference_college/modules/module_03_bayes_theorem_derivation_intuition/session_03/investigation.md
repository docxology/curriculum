## Research Question 1: How does Prior Probability Influence Bayesian Inference?

Methodology: This investigation will explore the crucial role of prior probability in Bayesian inference. We will simulate a scenario where a researcher is investigating a novel drug's efficacy in treating a rare disease. The researcher initially possesses a prior belief – based on limited early data and expert opinion – that the drug has a 5% chance of being effective (prior probability = 0.05).  The researcher then conducts a clinical trial with 100 patients.  The trial demonstrates that 15 patients show significant improvement – a clear positive signal. We will systematically model the data using the Bayesian formula: P(Drug Effective | Trial Results) = [P(Trial Results | Drug Effective) * P(Drug Effective)] / P(Trial Results). We will vary the initial prior probability (0.01, 0.1, 0.5) and observe how the posterior probability changes.  The simulation will explicitly show how a strong prior can significantly impact the final probability, even when the observed data appears compelling. We’ll utilize spreadsheet software to illustrate the calculations for different prior assumptions.  Furthermore, we'll incorporate a sensitivity analysis to quantify the degree of influence.

Expected Outcomes: This investigation will demonstrate that the prior probability significantly shapes the posterior probability in Bayesian inference. We anticipate that even with a strong positive signal from the clinical trial (15/100), a low prior probability (e.g., 0.01) will result in a lower posterior probability of the drug being effective compared to a high prior (e.g., 0.5).  The simulation will highlight the importance of incorporating prior knowledge alongside new data for informed decision-making.  The study will underscore the potential for bias if the prior is not carefully considered, while also demonstrating how updated data can refine even a deeply entrenched belief.  The resulting data will provide a concrete, quantifiable understanding of this central concept within Bayesian analysis.

## Research Question 2: What is the Effect of Data Quantity on Bayesian Inference?

Methodology: This research will investigate the relationship between the amount of data and the convergence of Bayesian inference. We'll simulate a scenario involving a binary outcome (success/failure) in a medical diagnostic test. We will perform the experiment with varying numbers of patients (e.g., 10, 50, 100, 500) to generate data points.  For each patient, we'll generate a binary outcome (positive or negative test result) according to a pre-defined underlying probability (e.g., the true probability of the disease).  The data will be collected and analyzed using the standard Bayesian formula. We’ll track the posterior probability of the disease given the data and compare it over increasing sample sizes. Crucially, we’ll use a relatively complex model with multiple parameters. The simulation will allow for controlled manipulation of the underlying parameters (e.g., the true disease prevalence) and allow observation of the effects of greater data volume. Data will be presented graphically with the posterior probabilities plotted against patient count.

Expected Outcomes:  We anticipate observing that as the amount of data increases, the posterior probability of the disease converges towards a stable value. This convergence will be more pronounced with a complex model. Initially, with fewer patients, the posterior probability will exhibit considerable fluctuation due to the influence of the prior. As the data set grows, the posterior probability will become increasingly stable, reflecting the greater certainty afforded by accumulating evidence. We’ll demonstrate a quantitative relationship between data volume and posterior probability stability. The study will reveal the core idea of Bayesian inference: the more evidence available, the more confident we become in our estimation of the parameter.

## Research Question 3: How Can We Measure the Impact of Model Complexity on Bayesian Inference?

Methodology: This investigation will assess the influence of model complexity on Bayesian inference using a scenario involving predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. We will employ increasingly complex models. The initial model will be a simple logistic regression with one predictor (e.g., customer tenure). A second model will include two additional predictors (e.g., customer service calls and data usage). Finally, a third model will incorporate interaction terms and polynomial terms to capture non-linear relationships.  We will generate synthetic data based on these models.  For each model, we will run the analysis with a fixed, moderate prior (e.g., 0.1) and 100 simulated patients. We'll meticulously calculate and compare the posterior probabilities of churn, alongside other relevant metrics such as the posterior mean and variance. We will visually compare the results to highlight differences. The calculations will be performed using a statistical software package.

Expected Outcomes: We anticipate that with increasing model complexity, the posterior probability of churn will become more stable and accurate. The simple logistic regression model will likely produce an initial probability that is highly sensitive to minor variations in the data. As we incorporate more complex relationships, the posterior probability will converge towards a more robust estimate. The complexity is likely to reduce model sensitivity to noise in the data.  The study will demonstrate a trade-off between model complexity and robustness, providing insights into how to select an appropriate model given the available data and the desired level of certainty.  The results will illustrate that overly complex models can be over-fitting of the data.
