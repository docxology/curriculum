**Module: Bayes’ Theorem – Derivation & Intuition**
**Lab Number: 3**
**Lab Focus: Conditional Probability Revisited**

**1. Brief Background (87 words)**

This laboratory exercise builds upon the foundational concepts presented in today’s lecture on Bayes’ Theorem. We’ll revisit the concept of conditional probability – the probability of an event (A) occurring given that another event (B) has already occurred. Understanding this relationship is crucial for applying Bayes’ Theorem, which relies on quantifying this conditional dependency. The lab will provide a practical experience in calculating conditional probabilities, directly supporting the mathematical framework we’ll explore later in the unit. [INSTRUCTOR: Briefly review the lecture’s definition of conditional probability and the P(A|B) formula].

**2. Lab Objectives (4 bullet points)**

*   Calculate the conditional probability of an event (A) given another event (B) using the P(A|B) formula.
*   Interpret the results of conditional probability calculations in the context of real-world scenarios.
*   Apply the formula to solve quantitative problems involving conditional relationships.
*   Recognize the impact of event B on the probability of event A.
*   Demonstrate proficiency in organizing and presenting data collected during the experiment.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   **Dice:** 2 standard six-sided dice (Quantity: 2)
*   **Data Collection Sheets:** Printed data collection sheets (Quantity: 20)
*   **Pencils:** (Quantity: 20)
*   **Calculators:** (Quantity: 20 – for verification only)
*   **Ruler:** (Quantity: 1 - for visual estimation)

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

*   **Potential Hazard:** Eye Strain – Prolonged close-up work can cause eye strain. Take frequent breaks (every 20 minutes) and look at objects at a distance.
*   **Hazard:** No specific chemical or biological hazards are present.
*   **PPE Requirements:** Wear safety goggles at all times during the experiment.  [INSTRUCTOR: Emphasize the importance of wearing goggles and not removing them during the exercise].
*   **Time-Sensitive Step:** Data collection should be completed within 60 minutes to minimize distractions.

**5. Procedure (6 steps)**

1.  **Roll the Dice:** Each student will roll both dice simultaneously. Record the outcome of each die separately on your data collection sheet.
2.  **Define Events:** For each roll, define event A as “The sum of the dice roll is greater than 7” and event B as “The first die roll is a 6”.
3.  **Calculate P(A|B):**  Determine the probability of event A given that event B has occurred.  This means, given that the first die rolled a 6, what is the probability that the sum of the dice is greater than 7?
4.  **Data Collection:**  Record your results (dice rolls, calculations of P(A|B) for each roll) on the provided data collection sheet.
5.  **Repeat:** Repeat steps 1-4 for a total of 10 rolls.
6.  **Data Consolidation:** Calculate the average value of P(A|B) across all 10 rolls. [INSTRUCTOR: Check students' calculations and provide feedback].

**6. Data Collection**

| Roll # | Die 1 | Die 2 | Sum | Event A (Sum > 7)? | Event B (Die 1 = 6)? | P(A|B) = P(A|B) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 7 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 8 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 9 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 10 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Total** |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**7. Analysis Questions (4 questions)**

1.  What is the value of P(A|B) for each roll? Explain how the value of P(A|B) changes depending on the outcome of event B.
2.  Considering the formula P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), discuss how your roll of the first die (event B) influences the probability of event A occurring (sum > 7).
3.  If event B were to be defined differently (e.g., “The first die roll is a 4”), how would this affect the value of P(A|B)?
4.  Calculate the average value of P(A|B) across all 10 rolls. What does this average value represent in the context of the experiment?

**8. Expected Results (2 sentences)**

Students should observe that the value of P(A|B) varies depending on the outcome of the first die roll (event B). The average value of P(A|B) should be approximately 0.5, representing the probability of the sum being greater than 7, given that the first die rolled a 6.
