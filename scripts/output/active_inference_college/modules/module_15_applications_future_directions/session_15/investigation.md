## Research Question 1: How does the introduction of a simulated predator (the *Daphnia magna*) affect the population dynamics of *Lemna minor* (duckweed) in a controlled aquatic environment?

**Methodology:** This investigation will utilize a controlled experimental setup within a sealed aquarium. Three treatment groups will be established: (1) a control group with no predator; (2) a treatment group with a low density of *Daphnia magna*; and (3) a treatment group with a high density of *Daphnia magna*. The aquarium will be maintained under consistent light and temperature conditions.  Duckweed density will be quantified using visual assessment and, if necessary, microscopic counts every 24 hours for a period of 7 days. Water quality parameters (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen) will be monitored and recorded daily. Statistical analysis (ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests) will be applied to compare the growth rates of duckweed across the treatment groups.  Control and experimental variables will be carefully documented and tracked throughout the experiment.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that the *Daphnia magna* population will significantly reduce the *Lemna minor* population in both the low and high density treatment groups. We expect the high density group to exhibit a more pronounced impact due to increased predation pressure.  The control group will demonstrate exponential growth in duckweed population.  The statistical analysis will provide quantitative evidence of the predator-prey relationship and allow us to determine the relationship between predator density and impact on prey population.  This study will highlight the complexities of trophic interactions within simplified ecosystems.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of varying water oxygen levels on the growth rate of *Lemna minor* (duckweed)?

**Methodology:** This experiment will employ three treatment groups, each exposed to a different dissolved oxygen concentration: (1) a control group with normal aquarium water oxygen levels (maintained through aeration); (2) a group exposed to reduced oxygen levels achieved via degassing the water with hydrogen per oxide; and (3) a group with elevated oxygen levels using a small oxygen stone.  Duckweed density will be measured using visual assessment and microscopic counts every 24 hours for 7 days. Water temperature, pH, and light intensity will be kept constant across all treatments.  Data will be collected and analyzed using statistical methods (ANOVA followed by post-hoc analysis) to determine the impact of varying oxygen levels on duckweed growth rates. The experiment will be conducted in triplicate to ensure reproducibility.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that lower oxygen levels will significantly inhibit duckweed growth due to reduced photosynthetic rates. Conversely, elevated oxygen levels will potentially stimulate growth up to a point, assuming sufficient nutrient availability. We anticipate a bell-shaped curve relationship between oxygen concentration and duckweed growth, with optimal growth occurring within a certain range. The results will provide insights into the importance of oxygen availability for aquatic plant productivity and the potential consequences of oxygen depletion in aquatic environments.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the rate of nutrient uptake by *Lemna minor* (duckweed)?

**Methodology:** This investigation utilizes a controlled nutrient solution experiment. Three groups of *Lemna minor* will be immersed in separate aquariums containing identical water and light conditions.  Each group will receive a different concentration of nitrates (a key nutrient) in the water: (1) a control group receiving no added nitrates; (2) a group with a low nitrate concentration; and (3) a group with a high nitrate concentration.  Duckweed density and chlorophyll content (measured spectrophotometrically) will be assessed daily for 7 days. Water changes will be conducted regularly to maintain consistent conditions.  Statistical analysis (ANOVA followed by post-hoc analysis) will be used to determine the relationship between nitrate concentration and duckweed growth, providing an insight into nutrient uptake efficiency.

**Expected Outcomes:** We predict that increased nitrate concentration will initially stimulate duckweed growth due to enhanced photosynthetic capacity.  However, we also anticipate a potential saturation point beyond which further increases in nitrate concentration will have no additional effect, or potentially become detrimental due to nutrient imbalances.  The data collected will provide a quantitative measure of nutrient uptake efficiency by *Lemna minor*, offering valuable information for understanding aquatic ecosystem productivity.
