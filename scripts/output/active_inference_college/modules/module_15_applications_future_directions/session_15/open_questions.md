are three open questions designed to represent current research frontiers, formatted exactly as specified, along with the requested context and research type indications.

## Open Question 1: What are the specific mechanistic pathways driving the observed increase in extreme weather events attributable to climate change beyond traditional greenhouse gas forcing?

Context:  Researchers are increasingly focused on identifying the non-linear and feedback loops amplifying climate change impacts.  While atmospheric CO2 remains a central driver, understanding how changes in ocean currents, cloud formation, and ice sheet dynamics are exacerbating extreme events – beyond simplistic models – is critical for accurate risk assessment and mitigation strategies. This question pushes the boundaries of climate modeling and requires integration of diverse scientific disciplines.

Current Research: Climate Modeling, Polar Science, Atmospheric Physics, Oceanography

## Open Question 2: How does the increasing prevalence of misinformation and disinformation on social media platforms impact public trust in scientific institutions and the acceptance of evidence-based policies related to public health?

Context:  The spread of inaccurate information online poses a significant challenge to effective policy-making and public understanding of complex issues, particularly those involving scientific consensus.  Research is increasingly examining the psychological and social factors influencing belief formation and the role of algorithms in amplifying misinformation. This question prompts exploration of network effects, cognitive biases, and the potential for interventions to combat the spread of false narratives.

Current Research: Social Network Analysis, Cognitive Psychology, Communication Studies, Political Science

## Open Question 3: What are the ethical implications of utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) in critical decision-making processes – particularly concerning bias amplification, accountability, and the potential for unintended consequences in sectors such as healthcare and finance?

Context:  The rapid advancement of LLMs presents both opportunities and risks.  Researchers are actively investigating the inherent biases present in training data, the challenges of ensuring transparency and accountability in algorithmic decision-making, and the broader societal impacts of relying on AI systems without sufficient human oversight.  This question addresses a crucial area of concern as LLMs become increasingly integrated into complex real-world systems.
