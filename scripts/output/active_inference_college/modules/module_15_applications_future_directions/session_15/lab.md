**Lab Number: 15 – Synthesis of Concepts**

**Module:** Applications & Future Directions

**Lab Focus:** Synthesis of Concepts

**1. Brief Background:**

This laboratory exercise directly builds upon our exploration of systems thinking, specifically the iterative modeling approach and the concept of emergence. We’ve discussed how seemingly simple interactions within a system can generate complex outcomes. This exercise will allow you to apply these concepts to a simplified, tangible system – a simulated ecosystem. Your goal is to build a basic model, identify emergent behavior, and refine your model based on observed outcomes, mirroring the iterative process discussed in the lecture. [INSTRUCTOR: Emphasize the connection between theoretical concepts and practical application.]

**2. Lab Objectives:**

*   Construct a simple ecosystem model utilizing readily available materials.
*   Observe and record the interactions between components of the ecosystem over a defined period.
*   Identify emergent behaviors within the model, such as population fluctuations or predator-prey dynamics.
*   Refine the model by introducing a single variable (e.g., food source abundance) and observing the resulting changes.
*   Document your observations and interpretations, demonstrating critical thinking about system dynamics.

**3. Materials and Equipment:**

*   **Containers:** 3 x 250 mL Beakers (labeled A, B, C)
*   **Substrate:** 100g Aquarium Gravel (for drainage & medium)
*   **Plant:** 10 *Lemna minor* (Duckweed) – Approximately 10 cm² total surface area.
*   **Small Animals:** 10 *Daphnia magna* – Approximately 2cm in length.
*   **Food Source:** 2g Dried Algae Powder (Spirulina)
*   **Water:** 400 mL Distilled Water
*   **Thermometer:** Digital Thermometer (resolution 0.1°C)
*   **Timer:** Stopwatch or Digital Timer
*   **Pipettes:** 5 mL Pipettes (x2)
*   **Magnifying Glass:** For detailed observation.

**4. Safety Considerations:**

⚠️ **Biological Hazard:** *Daphnia magna* are live organisms. Avoid direct skin contact. Dispose of all biological materials properly following laboratory protocols. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after the experiment.
⚠️ **Potential Allergies:** *Lemna minor* may trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. Use caution.
⚠️ **Glassware Handling:** Use caution when handling beakers to avoid breakage. Report any broken glassware immediately to [INSTRUCTOR].
⚠️ **Temperature:** Water temperature will be approximately 22°C. Monitor carefully to prevent excessive heating, which could lead to thermal shock.

**5. Procedure:**

1.  **Setup:** Divide the distilled water equally into the three beakers (A, B, and C).
2.  **Base Layer:** Add 100g of aquarium gravel to each beaker.
3.  **Plant Introduction:** Carefully add 10 *Lemna minor* to each beaker.
4.  **Animal Introduction:** Add 10 *Daphnia magna* to each beaker.
5.  **Initial Observation (5 min):** Observe and record initial population sizes and behaviors in each beaker. Note the density of *Lemna minor* and the movement of *Daphnia magna*.
6.  **Variable Introduction (Minute 6):** Add 2g of dried algae powder to Beaker A only.
7.  **Observation & Recording (10 min):** Continuously observe and record changes in all three beakers, focusing on population dynamics, algal growth, and *Daphnia magna* behavior.
8.  **Termination:** Stop the experiment when significant changes have occurred in all beakers or after a maximum of 20 minutes.

**6. Data Collection:**

| Time (Minutes) | Beaker A (Algae Added) - *Lemna minor* Density (cm²) | Beaker A - *Daphnia magna* Count | Beaker B (Control) - *Lemna minor* Density (cm²) | Beaker B - *Daphnia magna* Count | Beaker C (Control) - *Lemna minor* Density (cm²) | Beaker C - *Daphnia magna* Count | Observations (e.g., movement, color changes) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 10 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 15 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 20 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**7. Analysis Questions:**

1.  How did the introduction of the algae powder (Beaker A) affect the *Lemna minor* population? Explain your observations in terms of resource availability.
2.  Did you observe any changes in the behavior of the *Daphnia magna*? What might have caused these changes?
3.  How does this lab exercise illustrate the concept of emergence? What simple rules were followed by the individual organisms, and what complex outcome arose?
4.  If you were to repeat this experiment, what additional variables could you introduce to further explore the system’s dynamics?
5.  Considering the limitations of this simplified model, how could this experiment be improved to provide a more accurate representation of a real ecosystem?

**8. Expected Results:**

Students should observe that the *Lemna minor* population in Beaker A (with algae added) will likely increase significantly compared to the control beakers (B and C). The *Daphnia magna* population may also increase in Beaker A, possibly due to increased food availability.  *Daphnia magna* in Beaker A may exhibit increased feeding activity and movement.  These changes demonstrate how a small environmental perturbation (introduction of a food source) can trigger significant changes in a system’s behavior.
