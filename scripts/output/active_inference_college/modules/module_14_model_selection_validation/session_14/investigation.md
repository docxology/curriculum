## Research Question 1: The Impact of Feature Scaling on Linear Regression Model Performance

**Methodology:** To investigate the effect of feature scaling on the performance of a linear regression model, we will perform a controlled experiment using a synthetic dataset. The dataset will consist of two features – ‘X’ and ‘Y’ – where ‘Y’ is a linear function of ‘X’ plus some random noise. We will train a linear regression model with and without feature scaling (specifically, standardization – subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation). Standardization is a common and effective scaling method. We will evaluate the model’s performance using R-squared (a measure of how well the model fits the data) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). We will run the experiment three times with different randomly generated noise parameters to ensure the results are robust.  Data will be prepared using Python with Pandas and Scikit-learn libraries, including feature scaling, model training, and performance metric calculation. The entire process will be meticulously documented, including code snippets, data preparation steps, and the final results.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that the linear regression model *without* feature scaling will exhibit a significantly lower R-squared and a higher RMSE compared to the model *with* feature scaling. This is because without scaling, features with larger values will disproportionately influence the model's coefficients, leading to inaccurate parameter estimation and a poor fit to the data. We expect feature scaling to stabilize the coefficient magnitudes, preventing this bias and leading to a more accurate and reliable model. The experimental data should clearly demonstrate the positive impact of feature scaling, providing empirical evidence of its importance in improving linear regression model performance.

## Research Question 2: Exploring the Effects of Regularization (L1) on Polynomial Regression

**Methodology:** To investigate the impact of L1 regularization on polynomial regression, we will construct a dataset with a polynomial relationship between the input features and the target variable. The dataset will be generated using Python with NumPy and Scikit-learn. We will train a polynomial regression model with varying degrees of polynomial (e.g., degree 2, 3, 4) and also a regularized version of the same model using L1 (LASSO) regularization.  The regularization strength (the alpha parameter) will be varied to control the amount of penalty applied. We will evaluate the models’ performance using R-squared and Root Mean Squared Error. The models will be trained using cross-validation to obtain more robust estimates of their performance.  We will meticulously record the model parameters, regularization strength, and performance metrics for each model configuration. The comparison will be visually represented using graphs of the model's performance (R-squared and RMSE) as a function of the regularization strength.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that increasing the regularization strength (alpha) will lead to a decrease in R-squared as the model becomes increasingly constrained. However, this decrease will be less pronounced compared to the situation without regularization. We expect that the L1 regularization will induce sparsity in the model’s coefficients, effectively eliminating less important features from the model and leading to a more parsimonious (simpler) model. The results will highlight the trade-off between model complexity and accuracy, demonstrating how regularization can prevent overfitting and improve model generalization performance.

## Research Question 3: Quantifying the Relationship Between Data Size and Model Accuracy in Logistic Regression

**Methodology:** To assess the relationship between dataset size and model accuracy in logistic regression, we will systematically generate a dataset with a known underlying logistic function and a corresponding target variable.  We will use Python with Pandas and Scikit-learn to generate the data. We will train logistic regression models with increasing sample sizes (e.g., 100, 500, 1000, 5000 samples). For each sample size, we will train multiple logistic regression models, each with slightly different random initializations to account for the stochastic nature of the algorithm.  We will measure the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Data will be split into training and validation sets for each sample size to evaluate generalization performance. The experiment will be executed for at least 5 different runs to ensure results are robust to random initialization. All results will be meticulously logged, documenting the parameter settings, performance metrics, and the number of training epochs.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that as the dataset size increases, the model’s accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will generally improve. However, this improvement will diminish at larger sample sizes as the model approaches a state of near-perfect accuracy. We expect to observe a trend where the marginal gain in performance decreases with increasing sample sizes.  The experiment will provide empirical evidence demonstrating the principle of diminishing returns in machine learning, showcasing how the impact of adding more data eventually plateaus.  The results will be visualized through graphs, clearly illustrating the relationship between dataset size and model performance, thereby quantifying the trade-offs inherent in model training.
