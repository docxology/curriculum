## Probabilistic State-Space Models – Formulation

**Introduction**

Welcome back to Probabilistic State-Space Models. In the preceding sessions, we’ve explored the fundamental building blocks: stochastic processes, probability distributions, and the concept of perception-action loops. We’ve established that these loops, common across biological systems and artificial intelligence, often involve an agent interacting with an environment, receiving sensory input, and taking actions that modify the environment, and consequently, the agent’s internal state. Today, we delve into the heart of state-space modeling – formalizing these loops through a set of mathematical equations. These equations allow us to precisely describe how the agent’s state evolves over time, how it is influenced by sensory input, and how actions affect that evolution. We’ll be focusing on the core equations of state-space models, understanding their components, and appreciating their significance. Consider a simple example: a robot navigating a room. Its state might be its position and orientation; the sensory input would be data from its cameras and sensors; and its actions would be movements – turning left, turning right, moving forward.
