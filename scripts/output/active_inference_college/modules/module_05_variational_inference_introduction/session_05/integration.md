This session’s focus on Bayesian inference directly connects to Module 1’s introduction to probability and statistical modeling. The concept of a prior distribution, established in Module 1, is fundamental to Bayesian updating, a core component of variational inference. Furthermore, the subsequent exploration of the evidence lower bound (ELBO) in Module 2 mirrors the core principle of maximizing likelihood, a key technique taught in Module 1 for parameter estimation.  The iterative process of sampling from the approximate posterior and optimizing the ELBO builds directly on the foundational understanding of likelihood functions and maximum likelihood estimation developed in Module 1. Finally, the use of variational families to approximate the posterior – as discussed in Module 3 – represents a sophisticated extension of the principles of statistical inference explored earlier.

This topic builds on Module 1's foundation and extends to Module 4's application of these principles in complex biological systems. Specifically, the use of variational inference allows us to handle intractable integrals, a common issue in modeling complex biological networks – as covered in Module 2's discussion of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The concept of approximate inference is crucial when dealing with high-dimensional data, a theme that resonates with Module 3’s investigation of dimensionality reduction techniques. The iterative refinement of the prior based on observed data, a central element of variational inference, closely aligns with the Bayesian updating process introduced in Module 1.

This topic connects to Module 2’s exploration of MCMC methods and the challenges of sampling from high-dimensional posteriors. The use of variational families as a means of approximating the posterior distribution directly reflects the techniques for dealing with intractable integrals discussed in Module 2. The optimization of the ELBO, a key step in variational inference, is closely related to the convergence criteria and algorithms for MCMC methods presented in Module 2. Understanding the underlying mathematics of variational inference provides a valuable framework for comprehending the complexities of MCMC sampling and the challenges associated with generating accurate samples from complex posterior distributions – a central theme of the module.
