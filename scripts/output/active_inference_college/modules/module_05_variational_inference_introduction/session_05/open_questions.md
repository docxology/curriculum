## Open Question 1: What are the emergent properties of diffusion models in generative AI?

Context: Diffusion models have revolutionized image and audio generation, yet the underlying mechanisms driving their creativity remain partially opaque. Understanding the complex interplay of noise addition, denoising, and latent space exploration is crucial for improving model efficiency, controlling output diversity, and enabling novel applications in creative domains. Current research investigates how small changes in the architecture or training process dramatically alter the resulting imagery – a significant area of exploration.

## Open Question 2: How can variational autoencoders be adapted to handle multi-modal data streams in real-time?

Context: Traditionally, VAEs have been applied to single-modal data (e.g., images). Integrating them with diverse data streams – audio, text, sensor data – presents significant challenges, including data alignment, representation learning across different modalities, and computational complexity. Researchers are actively working on techniques to enable seamless fusion of these streams while maintaining data integrity and generating coherent, multi-faceted outputs.

## Open Question 3: What are the limitations of interpretability techniques within large language models (LLMs)?

Context: Despite advancements in interpretability methods for LLMs, such as attention visualization and probing, truly understanding the decision-making processes of these massive models remains elusive. Many techniques offer superficial insights, failing to address the inherent complexity and emergent behavior of the networks. Current research focuses on creating more robust and actionable methods to identify biases, vulnerabilities, and limitations within these powerful systems.
