## Research Question 1: The Impact of Prior Beliefs on Approximate Posterior Distributions

**Methodology:** This investigation will explore the sensitivity of approximate posterior distributions obtained through variational inference to the choice of the prior distribution (P(Z)). We will implement a simplified Bayesian model – a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) – with a known likelihood function. We'll generate synthetic data from this model and then run variational inference with three different prior distributions: a uniform distribution, a Gaussian distribution, and a Laplace distribution.  We’ll use the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) as a metric for evaluating the quality of the approximate posterior. Specifically, we will track the change in ELBO as we vary the prior. We will use Python with libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and potentially TensorFlow/PyTorch for implementing the GMM and the variational inference algorithms. We’ll compare the resulting approximate posteriors (represented as distributions) and assess their similarities to the true posterior (which, due to the synthetic nature of the data, we can compute directly). Statistical tests, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence, will be used to quantify the differences.  We will iterate, systematically modifying the prior and observing the effect on the final posterior.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate observing a significant correlation between the choice of prior and the resulting approximate posterior. The uniform prior will likely result in the most stable and well-defined posterior, as it provides a minimal constraint on the parameter space. The Gaussian prior, reflecting our initial belief about the parameters, will likely yield a posterior closer to the true posterior, provided the data aligns with its assumptions.  The Laplace distribution, with its heavier tails, might lead to a less stable posterior, particularly if the data contains outliers.  We expect the ELBO to be more sensitive to the prior when the true posterior is heavily influenced by outliers. This investigation aims to demonstrate a critical lesson of variational inference: the prior isn't just a starting point but actively shapes the resulting approximate inference.  The results will provide quantifiable evidence of the influence of priors in variational inference.

## Research Question 2:  The Role of Regularization Techniques in Stabilizing Variational Inference

**Methodology:** This research question investigates the effectiveness of different regularization techniques in stabilizing the approximate posterior distribution during variational inference. We will utilize a complex Bayesian model – a deep neural network trained to classify images – and repeat our experiment with a variety of regularization methods. Specifically, we will apply L1 (Lasso) regularization, L2 (Ridge) regularization, and Dropout regularization to the neural network’s weights.  We’ll generate synthetic data through simulation. During the inference step, we’ll monitor the ELBO, the variance of the approximate posterior, and the consistency of the weights across different iterations. We will use TensorFlow/PyTorch to implement the neural network and the variational inference algorithm.  The key measurements we'll collect will be the ELBO, the change in ELBO over time, and the variance of the approximate posterior distributions. We will perform a comparative analysis, directly comparing the performance of the models with and without regularization, and quantifying the improvement achieved. Statistical tests, such as t-tests, will be used to assess the significance of the differences.  We'll systematically adjust the regularization parameters (e.g., the L1 penalty strength) to determine optimal settings.

**Expected Outcomes:**  We anticipate that regularization will significantly improve the stability and convergence of the variational inference process. Specifically, we expect L2 regularization (Ridge) to consistently produce the most stable posterior distributions, minimizing the variance and preventing overfitting. L1 regularization (Lasso) might lead to sparsity in the weights, which, in this case, could improve interpretability. Dropout, by randomly deactivating neurons during training, should contribute to a more robust and generalizable posterior.  The results will provide a practical demonstration of how different regularization techniques can be employed to improve the quality of approximate inference in complex Bayesian models.

## Research Question 3:  Measuring the Sensitivity of ELBO to Model Complexity

**Methodology:** This study focuses on quantifying the relationship between model complexity (specifically, the number of parameters in a deep neural network) and the sensitivity of the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) during variational inference. We will implement a multi-layered deep neural network and train it on a real-world image classification dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10). We’ll systematically increase the network’s complexity by adding more layers and/or increasing the number of neurons per layer.  During the training phase, we'll continuously monitor the ELBO. We'll use TensorFlow/PyTorch to manage the training process.  We will also track the training loss and the validation accuracy.  Crucially, we’ll employ adaptive learning rates to ensure that the model converges appropriately as complexity increases.  We will perform a series of experiments, varying the network's architecture and training parameters, and collecting the ELBO and loss values for each experiment. The results will be plotted to visually represent the trend. The key statistical analyses will involve correlation analysis to determine the strength of the relationship between network complexity and ELBO sensitivity.

**Expected Outcomes:** We expect to observe a positive correlation between network complexity and the sensitivity of the ELBO. As the network becomes more complex, the ELBO will exhibit greater fluctuations and instability. This implies that very deep and/or high-dimensional models are more challenging to accurately approximate through variational inference. This research will demonstrate a fundamental trade-off: while increasing model capacity can improve predictive accuracy, it also increases the computational burden and the difficulty of obtaining a stable and reliable approximate posterior. This study will reveal a key challenge in applying variational inference to complex models, and inform the selection of appropriate model architectures and training strategies.
