Okay, let’s generate the three research questions and their associated descriptions, adhering strictly to the provided format and guidelines.

## Research Question 1: How does soil pH affect the germination rate of *Lactuca sativa* (lettuce)?

**Methodology:** This investigation will employ a controlled experiment using three distinct soil pH levels: 5.5, 6.8, and 8.2. One hundred *Lactuca sativa* seeds will be planted in individual pots for each pH level. The pots will be maintained under identical conditions: consistent temperature (22°C), humidity (60%), and light exposure (12 hours of daylight). Germination rates will be assessed daily for 7 days, counting the number of seedlings that have emerged. Data will be recorded meticulously, and statistical analysis (e.g., ANOVA) will be performed to determine if there are significant differences in germination rates across the different pH levels.  A replicated experimental design is crucial to minimize the impact of random variation.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that the germination rate will be most optimal at a pH level closest to the lettuce’s preferred range (around 6.0-7.0). We hypothesize that a more acidic pH (5.5) will significantly reduce germination, while a more alkaline pH (8.2) will also negatively impact germination. Statistical analysis is expected to reveal a significant correlation between soil pH and germination rate, providing quantitative data on the environmental sensitivity of *Lactuca sativa*.  The results will contribute to understanding the ecological factors influencing plant establishment.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of varying concentrations of sucrose on the growth rate of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (baker’s yeast)?

**Methodology:** This study will investigate the influence of sucrose concentration on yeast growth. Four experimental groups will be established, each containing a standardized volume of sterile nutrient broth. Each group will have a different sucrose concentration: 0g/L (control), 5g/L, 10g/L, and 15g/L.  All solutions will be inoculated with a consistent amount of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.  Samples will be measured every 24 hours for 72 hours using optical density (OD600) as a proxy for cell density.  Temperature will be maintained at 30°C.  Multiple replicates (n=3) will be performed to improve the reliability of the data.  Data will be plotted and analyzed to determine the optimal sucrose concentration for yeast growth.

**Expected Outcomes:** It is predicted that yeast will exhibit an initial growth response to increasing sucrose concentrations, reflecting the sugar's role as a primary energy source. However, exceeding a certain concentration threshold (likely due to osmotic stress or metabolic inhibition) will likely lead to a decline in growth rate. We hypothesize a positive correlation between low sucrose concentrations and growth rate.  The data will illustrate the direct relationship between sugar availability and metabolic activity in yeast, and will contribute to a better understanding of fermentation processes.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the enzymatic activity of amylase in potato starch solution?

**Methodology:** This investigation will quantify the activity of amylase, an enzyme responsible for breaking down starch, using a spectrophotometric assay.  A standardized potato starch solution will be prepared.  We will use amylase extracted from potatoes as the enzyme source. The spectrophotometer will measure the absorbance of the solution at 660 nm – a wavelength where starch exhibits a strong absorbance signal.  The reaction will be initiated by adding a measured amount of the amylase solution. The change in absorbance over time will be recorded, indicating the rate of starch breakdown. Control samples (without amylase) will be included for comparison. A standard curve will be generated using known concentrations of starch for accurate quantification.

**Expected Outcomes:** This experiment will provide a quantifiable measure of amylase activity, expressed as units of activity (e.g., units/mL).  The data will illustrate the rate at which starch is hydrolyzed by amylase. The experiment will demonstrate the principles of enzymatic kinetics and will provide insights into factors influencing enzyme activity, such as temperature or pH (which could be explored as extensions). The data will validate the practical application of spectrophotometry in biochemical assays.
