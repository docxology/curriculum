are three open questions designed to represent current research frontiers, along with the requested formatting and context.

## Open Question 1: What are the underlying mechanisms driving the recent surge in "long-COVID" symptoms, particularly persistent neurological and cognitive deficits?

Context: The global rise in reported symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection, now termed “long-COVID,” presents a significant public health challenge. While viral persistence and immune dysregulation are implicated, the precise mechanisms driving persistent neurological and cognitive impairments—such as fatigue, brain fog, and anxiety—remain largely unknown. Research is urgently needed to identify specific biomarkers and pathways involved in this complex condition.

## Open Question 2: How do engineered gut microbiomes – specifically, rationally designed consortia of microbial species – impact the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies?

Context: Immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, have revolutionized cancer treatment, but many patients don't respond. Emerging research suggests the gut microbiome plays a critical role in modulating the immune response.  Scientists are now investigating whether precisely engineered gut microbial communities, tailored to enhance anti-tumor immunity, can dramatically improve the effectiveness of immunotherapy by influencing systemic immune cell activity and modulating the tumor microenvironment.

## Open Question 3: What are the potential implications of incorporating synthetic biology approaches – including CRISPR-mediated gene editing – to enhance the resilience of coral reefs to rising ocean temperatures and acidification?

Context: Coral reefs are facing unprecedented threats from climate change, with bleaching events becoming increasingly frequent and severe. Researchers are exploring innovative solutions, including synthetic biology, to bolster coral resilience. This research focuses on developing bioengineered coral strains or utilizing CRISPR-based gene editing to enhance coral’s tolerance to stress factors like elevated temperatures and decreased pH levels – a critical step in mitigating the ongoing coral reef crisis.
