**Question 1:** Which of the following best describes the primary role of ribosomes in a cell?
A) Synthesizing lipids
B) Translating mRNA into proteins
C) Digesting cellular waste products
D) Storing genetic information
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis by reading mRNA sequences and assembling amino acids into polypeptide chains, forming proteins. This process is fundamental to cell function and survival.

**Question 2:** What is the significance of a null hypothesis in statistical testing?
A) It represents the researcher’s preferred outcome.
B) It assumes the absence of an effect or relationship.
C) It always confirms the researcher’s initial assumptions.
D) It’s a formalized statement of the alternative hypothesis.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The null hypothesis is a statement of no effect or no difference, which is then tested against the evidence (data). It provides a baseline to determine if there's sufficient evidence to reject it.

**Question 3:**  What does the term "Bayesian inference" primarily refer to?
A) Using frequentist statistical methods for data analysis.
B) Updating beliefs based on new evidence, incorporating prior knowledge.
C)  Analyzing data solely based on observed frequencies.
D)  Employing solely observational studies without intervention.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Bayesian inference involves updating prior beliefs about a parameter through the incorporation of observed data, resulting in a posterior distribution reflecting updated knowledge.

**Question 4:** What is a key difference between AIC and BIC?
A) They both provide identical measures of model fit.
B) BIC penalizes model complexity more heavily than AIC.
C) AIC always favors simpler models.
D) BIC is only applicable to linear regression models.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Both metrics assess model fit, but BIC incorporates a penalty term to discourage overfitting, making it particularly useful for model selection with large datasets.

**Question 5:**  Which of the following is a core concept in Bayesian model comparison?
A)  Rejecting any model with a high likelihood.
B)  Selecting the model with the highest likelihood value.
C)  Evaluating the model evidence, representing the relative support for different models.
D)  Focusing exclusively on the marginal likelihood.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The model evidence is a critical measure, quantifying the relative support for a model compared to other models, directly addressing the question of model selection.

**Question 6:**  Describe the role of the prior distribution in Bayesian modeling?
**Answer:** The prior distribution represents our initial belief about a parameter before observing any datA) It’s a probability distribution reflecting our existing knowledge or assumptions, and it influences the posterior distribution, which then incorporates the information derived from the data.

**Question 7:**  Explain how a likelihood ratio test is used to compare models.?
**Answer:** The likelihood ratio test compares the likelihood of the data under two different models. If the ratio of the likelihoods is greater than 1, it suggests that the more complex model provides significantly better evidence for the data, indicating a better fit.

**Question 8:**  In the context of model selection, what does "overfitting" refer to?
**Answer:** Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and captures random noise in the data, rather than the underlying true relationship. This leads to poor performance on new, unseen data.

**Question 9:**  How does the model evidence relate to the posterior probability of a model?
**Answer:** The model evidence is proportional to the posterior probability of a model, representing the relative support or likelihood of the model given the observed data and the prior distribution.
