## Research Question 1: The Impact of Social Media Usage on Teenagers' Self-Esteem

**Methodology:** This investigation will employ a mixed-methods approach. Initially, a quantitative survey will be distributed to 200 teenagers (aged 13-19) recruited from local schools and community centers. The survey will utilize validated scales measuring social media usage patterns (frequency, platform preferences, types of content consumed) and self-esteem levels (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale).  Statistical analysis, including correlation and regression analysis, will be conducted to determine the relationship between these variables.  Subsequently, 10-15 teenagers will be selected for semi-structured interviews to explore the qualitative nuances of their experiences – how they perceive their online identity, the impact of social comparison, and the role of online validation on their self-worth. Interview data will be analyzed using thematic analysis.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate finding a moderate positive correlation between frequent social media use (particularly platforms emphasizing visual content like Instagram and TikTok) and lower self-esteem scores.  However, we also expect to identify mitigating factors, such as strong offline social support and a critical awareness of social media’s curated nature, which may buffer against these negative effects. The qualitative interviews will provide rich contextual data, potentially revealing unexpected relationships and highlighting the diverse ways teenagers navigate the complexities of social media and its impact on their psychological well-being. This will add depth to the statistical findings and provide valuable insights for developing targeted interventions.

## Research Question 2: Examining the Correlation Between Academic Performance and Study Habits in College Students

**Methodology:** This study will utilize a correlational design to explore the relationship between student academic performance and their study habits. Data will be collected from 150 undergraduate students enrolled in introductory university courses across various disciplines. Participants will complete a detailed questionnaire assessing their study habits, including techniques employed (e.g., spaced repetition, active recall, summarizing), study environment, time management strategies, and perceived study effectiveness. Simultaneously, participants will provide their self-reported GPA, allowing for a direct comparison. The data will be analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficient to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between study habits and academic performance.  Additionally, we will conduct subgroup analysis based on major (e.g., STEM vs. Humanities) to identify potential differences in the relationship.  Outliers and confounding variables will be addressed through appropriate statistical techniques.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize a positive correlation between the utilization of effective study habits (e.g., active recall, spaced repetition) and higher GPA scores. We anticipate that students who engage in more structured and active study methods will demonstrate improved academic outcomes.  The subgroup analysis could reveal that certain study habits are more effective in specific disciplines, reflecting the varying demands of different academic fields. This research will contribute to developing personalized study strategies and enhance students' learning effectiveness.

## Research Question 3: Investigating the Influence of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) on Anxiety Levels in Individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder

**Methodology:** This study will conduct a quasi-experimental design to assess the efficacy of a brief CBT intervention on anxiety levels among individuals diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). 60 participants meeting GAD diagnostic criteria (as assessed using the GAD-7 scale) will be recruited from mental health clinics and community support groups. Participants will be randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a waitlist control group. The intervention group (30 participants) will receive a 6-week CBT program focusing on identifying and challenging negative thoughts, relaxation techniques, and behavioral modification strategies. The waitlist control group (30 participants) will receive standard care.  Anxiety levels will be measured using the GAD-7 scale at baseline, week 6, and week 12.  Data will be analyzed using independent samples t-tests and repeated measures ANOVA to determine the effect of the CBT intervention on anxiety levels compared to the control group.  Furthermore, qualitative feedback will be collected from the intervention group regarding their experience with the program.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that the CBT intervention group will demonstrate a significant reduction in anxiety levels (as measured by the GAD-7 scale) compared to the waitlist control group.  The intervention is expected to provide effective, accessible support. The qualitative feedback gathered will further illuminate participants' experiences and provide valuable insights for program refinement and future research. This study will contribute to the evidence base for CBT as a treatment option for GAD.
