## Open Question 1: What is the role of microglial-mediated synaptic pruning in the long-term maintenance of cognitive function?

Context: Recent research indicates that synaptic pruning, a process involving the elimination of synapses, is crucial for optimizing brain circuitry and enhancing cognitive function. However, the precise role of microglia – the brain’s resident immune cells – in orchestrating this process is still largely unknown. Understanding how microglia contribute to synaptic pruning is vital for developing targeted therapies for neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline. Current research is investigating the molecular mechanisms involved, with a focus on identifying key signaling pathways and identifying the precise timing of microglial activity.

## Open Question 2: How does the gut microbiome influence neuroinflammation and its impact on mental health disorders?

Context: The bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system (the gut-brain axis) is increasingly recognized as a significant factor in mental health. Emerging evidence suggests that imbalances in the gut microbiome can trigger neuroinflammation, a key contributor to disorders like depression and anxiety. Identifying the specific microbial metabolites and signaling pathways involved in this process is a major area of investigation, potentially leading to novel microbiome-based therapeutic interventions.  Current research utilizes animal models and human observational studies to explore this complex relationship.

## Open Question 3: What are the implications of topological analysis of brain networks for predicting individual vulnerability to post-stroke cognitive impairment?

Context:  Brain networks—complex interconnected systems of neural activity—are hypothesized to play a significant role in cognitive function and recovery after neurological injury. Topological analysis, a mathematical approach for characterizing network structure, is now being applied to quantify the degree of network disruption following stroke.  By assessing network topology (e.g., modularity, connectivity strength), researchers are aiming to identify predictive biomarkers that can identify individuals at higher risk of developing persistent cognitive deficits, improving rehabilitation strategies and patient outcomes.  Current research employs advanced neuroimaging techniques like diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state fMRI.
