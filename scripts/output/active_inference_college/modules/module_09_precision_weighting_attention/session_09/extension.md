## Topic 1: Predictive Coding and Neural Oscillations

Recent research strongly suggests a deep connection between predictive coding models and the role of neural oscillations in shaping perception. Traditionally, predictive coding has been framed as a hierarchical error signal mechanism – the brain constantly predicts sensory input and adjusts its models based on the discrepancy between prediction and reality. However, emerging evidence indicates that the timing and frequency of these error signals are orchestrated by neural oscillations, particularly in the theta and gamma bands. Specifically, theta oscillations are increasingly recognized as crucial for maintaining a ‘soft’ representation of the world, while gamma oscillations are linked to active prediction and the detection of unexpected events. Investigations utilizing magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) reveal that changes in oscillatory power correlate with both prediction accuracy and the perceived novelty of stimuli. Current investigations are focused on understanding how different oscillatory frequencies contribute to distinct aspects of predictive processing, including attention allocation and contextual modulation. Further research is exploring the role of synchronized oscillations across cortical areas in implementing efficient predictive models.

## Topic 2: Bayesian Brain and Free Energy Minimization

The “Bayesian brain” hypothesis offers a compelling framework for understanding how the brain processes information. This theory posits that the brain perpetually seeks to minimize “free energy,” a mathematical concept that represents the surprise or uncertainty associated with sensory input. Essentially, the brain builds probabilistic models of the world and constantly updates these models based on incoming evidence. This process is driven by minimizing the energy associated with a mismatch between predicted and actual sensory experiences.  Recent advancements in computational neuroscience are leveraging this framework to create more realistic models of sensory perception. Free energy minimization is not just a theoretical construct; it’s directly linked to the neural dynamics observed during perception. Researchers are using mathematical tools, such as information theory, to quantify the amount of information being actively processed by the brain and relate it to the underlying oscillatory activity. Investigations are also examining how factors like prior experience and context influence the minimization process, suggesting that learning involves gradually refining these probabilistic models through repeated exposure.

## Topic 3: Microstates and Sensory Experience

The concept of “microstates” provides a revolutionary perspective on sensory experience. Proposed by Michael Behrmann and colleagues, microstates theorize that the brain doesn’t represent sensory stimuli directly, but rather navigates a landscape of possible configurations – each representing a unique sensory experience. These microstates are generated through the complex interplay of neural activity, and the brain ‘samples’ this landscape to determine the most probable sensory interpretation.  Critically, the number of microstates accessible to the brain is limited, and this constraint impacts our ability to perceive certain stimuli. For instance, ambiguous figures can activate multiple microstates simultaneously, leading to perceptual instability. Researchers are using computational models to simulate this microstate landscape and test predictions about how changes in neural parameters—such as firing rates and connectivity—influence perceptual outcomes.  Emerging research explores how this microstate theory can explain phenomena like color constancy (the brain’s ability to perceive colors consistently under varying lighting conditions) and the neural basis of hallucinations.
