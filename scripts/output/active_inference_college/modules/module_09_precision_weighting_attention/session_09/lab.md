**Module: Precision Weighting & Attention – Lab 9: Precision of States**

**Lab Number:** 9
**Lab Focus:** Precision of States

**1. Brief Background (87 words)**

Following our discussion on attention gates and the dynamic nature of internal states, this lab investigates how the brain prioritizes these internal representations. We will explore the concept of “precision weighting,” focusing on how the perceived intensity of an internal state influences behavioral responses. Specifically, we will examine the impact of subtly varying the perceived ‘weight’ of a controlled internal stimulus – a simulated feeling of ‘warmth’ – on a simple reaction time task. The goal is to observe the brain’s ability to modulate its response based on this internal weighting.

**2. Lab Objectives:**

*   Identify the impact of a controlled internal stimulus (simulated warmth) on reaction time.
*   Quantify the changes in reaction time associated with variations in perceived stimulus intensity.
*   Record subjective ratings of perceived stimulus intensity.
*   Analyze the relationship between subjective ratings and objective reaction time measurements.

**3. Materials and Equipment:**

*   **Electronics:**
    *   Computer with [INSTRUCTOR]’s Lab Software (version 2.3) – includes visual stimulus presentation and data logging.
    *   Stimulus Presentation Software – Pre-configured with a grayscale square stimulus.
    *   USB Data Acquisition Device – Connected to computer.
*   **Human Subjects:** 
    *   Participant(s) – [NUMBER] participants (minimum 6 recommended)
    *   Comfortable Chair – Adjustable height and back support.
*   **Measurement Tools:**
    *   Reaction Time Measurement Device – Integrated with Lab Software.
    *   Stopwatch (Secondary Verification - 1 second resolution)
    *   Temperature Controlled Room - Maintained at 22°C ± 1°C.

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

⚠️ **Electrical Safety:** Ensure all equipment is properly grounded and that participants maintain a safe distance from electrical components. [INSTRUCTOR] will demonstrate proper use.
⚠️ **Eye Strain:** Participants should take frequent breaks (every 20 minutes) to minimize eye strain. Instruct them to look away from the screen at a distance of at least 6 feet.
⚠️ **Potential for Discomfort:** Monitor participants for signs of distress or discomfort.  [INSTRUCTOR] will be available to address any concerns immediately.
⚠️ **Equipment Damage:** Do not drop, spill liquids on, or otherwise damage any equipment. Report any malfunctions to [INSTRUCTOR].

**5. Procedure:**

1.  **Setup:** Each participant sits comfortably in front of the computer. Ensure the room temperature is 22°C ± 1°C.
2.  **Calibration:** Participants perform a 10-trial calibration task within the Lab Software, measuring their baseline reaction time to the grayscale square stimulus.
3.  **Weight Variation Trials:** The Lab Software will present the grayscale square stimulus with varying levels of perceived “warmth” (controlled by the Software - intensity ranges from 20% to 80% of maximum stimulus). Participants will be instructed to respond as quickly as possible to a presented button on the screen.  The Software will record reaction time for each trial.
4.  **Rating Scale:** Following each trial, participants will rate their perceived stimulus intensity on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = Not at all warm, 7 = Extremely warm) using the mouse click.
5.  **Repeat:** Continue this procedure for 30 trials, presenting the stimulus at varying intensity levels.
6.  **Debriefing:** [INSTRUCTOR] will conduct a brief debriefing session.

**6. Data Collection:**

| Trial | Reaction Time (ms) | Rating (1-7) |
|-------|--------------------|--------------|
| 1     |                    |              |
| 2     |                    |              |
| ...   |                    |              |
| 30    |                    |              |

**7. Analysis Questions:**

1.  How did reaction time change as the perceived warmth (stimulus intensity) increased? Explain the observed trend.
2.  What does the rating scale data suggest about the relationship between subjective perception and objective reaction time?
3.  How might neurological mechanisms, such as attention gates, explain these observed changes in behavior?
4.  If the stimulus intensity was increased to 100%, would you predict that reaction time would continue to decrease? Justify your answer.

**8. Expected Results:**

Participants should observe a trend: as the perceived warmth (stimulus intensity) increases, reaction time will likely decrease initially. This decrease reflects the brain prioritizing the 'warmth' stimulus, effectively modulating its response. Initially, the reaction time should decrease as participants more quickly and consistently respond. At higher intensity levels, the reaction time might plateau or even slightly increase due to attentional fatigue or sensory overload.  The rating scale data will provide a direct measure of the subjective intensity experienced during each trial, correlating with the observed changes in reaction time.
