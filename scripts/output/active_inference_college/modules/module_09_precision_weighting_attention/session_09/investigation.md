## Research Question 1: How does task complexity influence the accuracy of visual search?

Methodology: This research will employ a controlled experiment using a sample of 30 undergraduate psychology students. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: a low-complexity task group (identifying a single, distinct shape), a medium-complexity task group (identifying a shape amidst several similar shapes), and a high-complexity task group (identifying a shape amongst a large number of complex, subtly different shapes). All participants will be presented with visual stimuli on a computer screen and will be tasked with locating the target shape as quickly and accurately as possible. Reaction time and accuracy (number of correct responses) will be recorded for each participant.  Eye-tracking data will also be collected to assess visual search patterns. Data will be analyzed using ANOVA to determine the effect of task complexity on both reaction time and accuracy.

Expected Outcomes: We hypothesize that participants performing the high-complexity task will exhibit significantly longer reaction times and lower accuracy rates compared to those performing the low- and medium-complexity tasks. This is predicted to occur because the high-complexity task demands greater attentional resources and more sophisticated visual discrimination skills. The medium-complexity task is expected to fall in between, with a moderate impact on performance.  The findings will provide quantitative evidence linking task complexity to attentional demands and visual search strategies, offering insights into how cognitive resources are allocated during visual search.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of varying arousal levels on episodic memory retrieval?

Methodology:  This study will investigate the impact of arousal levels on episodic memory performance. Forty participants will be randomly assigned to one of four arousal conditions: high arousal (stimulation through music and moderate lighting), moderate arousal (standard lab conditions), low arousal (quiet, dimly lit room), and a control group (standard lab conditions).  Participants will be presented with a series of novel, personally relevant stories.  Immediately after hearing each story, they will be asked to recall as many details as possible. Recall accuracy (number of details correctly recalled) will be assessed using a structured recall protocol.  Subjective ratings of arousal levels will be collected using a visual analog scale at the end of the task. Statistical analysis will involve a two-way ANOVA with arousal level and condition as independent variables and recall accuracy as the dependent variable.

Expected Outcomes: We predict that participants experiencing high arousal will demonstrate enhanced episodic memory recall accuracy compared to those in the moderate and low arousal conditions. This heightened recall is anticipated due to the increased excitability of the nervous system and the potential for enhanced synaptic plasticity during memory consolidation. Conversely, the low arousal group is predicted to show the poorest performance. The research will contribute to our understanding of how physiological state influences cognitive processes, particularly memory, highlighting the role of arousal in memory encoding and retrieval.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the subjective experience of flow?

Methodology: This study will utilize a mixed-methods approach to investigate the subjective experience of flow.  Participants (60) will engage in a challenging but manageable activity – playing a complex video game (e.g., a strategy game). Physiological data (heart rate variability, electrodermal activity) and self-report measures (a validated Flow State Scale questionnaire, open-ended reflection prompts) will be collected continuously during gameplay.  Participants will rate their perceived experience of flow on a Likert scale every 5 minutes.  Following the gameplay session, participants will complete a semi-structured interview to elaborate on their experiences, describing the sensations, emotions, and cognitive processes they encountered.  Data analysis will involve correlating physiological measures with self-report ratings and thematic analysis of the interview transcripts to identify key patterns and themes associated with the flow state.

Expected Outcomes: We anticipate that participants reporting higher levels of flow will exhibit distinct physiological profiles, characterized by increased heart rate variability (a measure of attentional regulation) and reduced electrodermal activity (indicating reduced anxiety). The qualitative data from the interviews will provide rich insights into the perceptual and cognitive characteristics of the flow state, such as loss of self-consciousness, a sense of control, and focused attention. This mixed-methods approach will deliver a comprehensive understanding of the subjective experience of flow, providing actionable data for designing activities that maximize the potential for flow engagement.
