**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Which of the following best describes the concept of “precision weighting” in relation to internal states?
A) A random fluctuation in neuronal activity
B) The brain’s ability to assign different levels of importance to internal sensations
C) A passive reception of sensory information without processing
D) A complete disregard for prior experiences when forming new internal states
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** “Precision weighting” refers to the brain’s nuanced control over the significance of internal states, modulating the perceived intensity of these representations based on contextual factors. This allows the brain to prioritize relevant information.

**Question 3:** How do internal states contribute to our perception of the world?
A) They completely dictate our behaviors, regardless of external stimuli.
B) They are irrelevant to our experience and are simply a byproduct of neuronal activity.
C) They provide a framework for interpreting sensory information and guiding our actions.
D) They have no impact on our subjective experience.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Internal states don’t simply register sensations; they shape how we interpret them, influencing our decisions and behaviors by providing a context for experiencing the world.

**Question 4:**  What is the key difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?
A) Prokaryotic cells are larger and more complex.
B) Eukaryotic cells have a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles; prokaryotic cells do not.
C) Prokaryotic cells perform photosynthesis; eukaryotic cells do not.
D) Eukaryotic cells contain DNA, while prokaryotic cells do not.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:**  Eukaryotic cells possess a defined nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, reflecting a higher level of cellular organization compared to the simpler structure of prokaryotic cells.

**Question 5:**  If you experience a strong feeling of anticipation before a performance, which internal state is MOST directly involved?
A) A purely sensory experience without cognitive processing.
B) A subconscious motor command automatically initiating the action.
C) A complex state encompassing predictions, expectations, and potential emotional responses.
D) A random burst of adrenaline, unrelated to any specific thought or feeling.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Anticipation involves a combination of projected outcomes, expected sensations, and potential emotional responses – making it a sophisticated internal state constructed from multiple sources.

**Question 6:**  Briefly describe the role of attention gates in the brain. (Short Answer?)?
**Answer:** Attention gates are neuronal networks that act as switches, selectively allowing specific pathways to be activated while simultaneously inhibiting others. This mechanism prevents the brain from being overwhelmed by sensory input, focusing processing power on what's most relevant to the current situation. Key points include their role in prioritization and resource allocation.

**Question 7:**  Explain how variations in the perceived intensity of a controlled internal stimulus (like ‘warmth’) could impact a reaction time task. (Short Answer?)?
**Answer:** A stronger perceived ‘warmth’ (increased stimulus intensity) would likely lead to a faster reaction time due to increased arousal and heightened attention. Conversely, a weaker stimulus might result in a slower reaction time because less focus and urgency are present. Key points include the influence of internal stimuli on motor output.

**Question 8:**  Discuss a real-world application where understanding precision weighting could be beneficial (e.g., in robotics or human-computer interaction). (Short Answer?)?
**Answer:**  Consider a robotic system navigating a cluttered environment. Precision weighting could allow the robot to prioritize sensory inputs based on relevance—focusing intently on an approaching obstacle while subtly filtering out background noise.  Key points include adaptive control and sensory prioritization.

**Question 9:**  Synthesize the concepts of “attention gates” and “precision weighting” to explain how the brain adapts to changing environments. (Essay?)?
**Answer:** The brain continuously adapts by dynamically adjusting both attention gates and precision weighting. Attention gates filter incoming sensory information based on the current context, while precision weighting modulates the significance of internal states, prioritizing relevant data for immediate action.  This combined process enables the brain to rapidly respond to novel situations and maintain focus in dynamic environments, incorporating predictive coding and feedback loops.

**Question 10:**  Describe a scenario where a miscalibration of “precision weighting” could lead to a maladaptive behavior. (Essay?)?
**Answer:**  Consider an individual experiencing anxiety. If the brain excessively weights internal states associated with fear (e.g., perceived threats) without adequate contextual assessment, this could manifest as heightened vigilance, avoidance behaviors, and an inability to effectively manage stressful situations. This over-weighting results in an amplified, dysfunctional response, highlighting the importance of proper calibration for healthy adaptive behavior.
