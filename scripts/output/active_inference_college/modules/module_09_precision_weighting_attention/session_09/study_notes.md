## Precision Weighting & Attention: Lecture Notes

**Introduction:**

Welcome to Precision Weighting & Attention. This module explores how the brain selectively processes information, focusing on the nuanced control of attention – not just *what* we attend to, but *how much* significance we assign to different internal states. This allows us to tailor our perception and behavior, much like adjusting the volume on a radio.

**1. Internal States**: Internal States: Dynamic assessments of the internal environment, constantly constructed from sensory input, motor output, and prior experience. These encompass emotional states, alertness levels, motor intentions, and even subconscious memories. They represent the brain's ongoing evaluation of its own internal state.

**2. Attention Gates**: Attention Gates: Neuronal networks that act as switches, controlling the activation of specific pathways, allowing relevant information to be processed while irrelevant information is filtered out. This is the foundational mechanism behind selective attention.

**3. Precision Weighting**: Precision Weighting: The process of assigning varying degrees of importance to internal states, influencing the strength of associated neural signals and ultimately shaping our perception of the world. It’s a core component of the brain’s attentional control system.

**4. State-Dependent Plasticity**: State-Dependent Plasticity: The phenomenon where the brain’s neural connections are strengthened or weakened based on the prevailing internal state. For example, if you repeatedly attend to a particular object, the neural pathways associated with processing that object will become more efficient. *Think:* “State – Shape – Strengthen.”

**5. Predictive Coding**: Predictive Coding: A theoretical framework suggesting that the brain constantly generates predictions about sensory input and then compares these predictions to actual sensory data. Discrepancies between predictions and reality trigger adjustments in neural activity, effectively weighting internal states based on their accuracy.

**6. Bayesian Inference**: Bayesian Inference: A mathematical framework used to explain how the brain combines prior beliefs (prior probabilities) with new evidence (likelihoods) to form updated beliefs. This process heavily influences the weighting of internal states, prioritizing those aligned with current sensory information.

**7. Contextual Modulation**: Contextual Modulation: The influence of the surrounding environment or situation on the weighting of internal states. A familiar setting might increase the significance of certain memories, while a novel environment could shift the weighting towards novelty detection.

**8. Hierarchical Attention**: Hierarchical Attention: An attentional system organized in layers, with higher-level areas influencing the weighting of information processed by lower-level areas. This allows for flexible and adaptive attention, prioritizing relevant information at different levels of abstraction.

**9. Neural Oscillations**: Neural Oscillations: Rhythmic patterns of neural activity that play a critical role in coordinating attention. Different frequencies of oscillations are associated with different attentional processes, further influencing the weighting of internal states. *Mnemonics:* “Oscillations – Orchestrate – Output.”

**10. Attentional Drift**: Attentional Drift: The tendency for attention to spontaneously wander away from the target stimulus, highlighting the dynamic and sometimes unstable nature of attentional control and illustrating the importance of actively maintaining focus and weighting.
