## Introduction to Chemical Calculations

Welcome back to our module on Introduction to Chemical Calculations. In the previous sessions, we’ve covered balancing chemical equations and understanding the mole concept – fundamental building blocks for tackling quantitative problems in chemistry. We’ve established that a balanced equation represents the *ratio* of reactants and products, and that the **Mole**: the fundamental unit of amount in the SI system, allows us to relate mass, volume, and number of particles.  This allows us to predict how much product will form based on the starting materials. Today’s session focuses on a crucial aspect of these calculations: stoichiometric calculations, specifically dealing with limiting reactants and percent yield. These concepts bridge the gap between the theoretical ideal of a reaction and the reality of chemical processes. We’ll explore how to determine the maximum amount of product we can expect to form and how to assess the efficiency of a reaction.

## Determining Limiting Reactants

Let's consider a reaction where you have a specific quantity of each reactant. To determine the limiting reactant, you must:

1.  Calculate the number of moles of each reactant, using their molar masses.
2.  Compare the mole ratios from the balanced equation to determine which reactant will be completely consumed first. The reactant with the smaller mole ratio is the limiting reactant.

**Example:** Consider the reaction: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O

If we have 4 grams of hydrogen (H₂) and 32 grams of oxygen (O₂), which reactant will limit the reaction? Let’s calculate the moles of each:

*   Moles of H₂ = mass / molar mass = 4 g / 2.02 g/mol = 1.98 moles
*   Moles of O₂ = mass / molar mass = 32 g / 32.00 g/mol = 1.00 mole

The reactant with the *smallest* number of moles – in this case, oxygen (O₂) – is the limiting reactant. This means that all 4 grams of hydrogen will react with all 1.00 mole of oxygen. The reaction will stop once all the oxygen is consumed.

## Calculating Percent Yield

Percent yield is a measure of the efficiency of a chemical reaction. It's calculated as:

Percent Yield = (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) * 100%

This percentage indicates the ratio of the actual product obtained to the maximum possible product. A higher percent yield indicates a more efficient reaction.
