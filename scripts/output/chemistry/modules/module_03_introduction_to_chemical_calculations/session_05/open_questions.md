## Open Question 1: What is the proposed mechanism for the degradation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) by engineered bacteriophages?

Context: The widespread contamination of water sources with PFAS chemicals poses a significant global health and environmental challenge.  Current remediation efforts are limited, and understanding the natural breakdown processes is crucial. Engineered bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) offer a potential solution, but the precise mechanisms of their action are not fully elucidated. Research is focused on identifying the enzymatic pathways and viral-host interactions involved.

Current research: Microbial ecology and virology, enzyme kinetics, protein-protein interactions, synthetic biology.

## Open Question 2:  What are the potential implications of the recent detection of microbial life signatures (methane production) within the subsurface of Enceladus, Saturn’s moon?

Context:  The discovery of plumes emanating from Enceladus, indicating a subsurface ocean, has revolutionized our understanding of potential habitability beyond Earth. The detection of elevated methane concentrations within these plumes – a potential biosignature – raises fundamental questions about the origin of this methane and the possibility of extant microbial life.  This finding necessitates investigation into potential biological, geological, and geochemical processes.

Current research: Astrobiology, geochemistry, oceanography, remote sensing, extremophile microbiology, habitability assessments.

## Open Question 3:  How does the utilization of biochar derived from agricultural waste impact the carbon sequestration potential of restored peatlands?

Context:  Peatlands are significant carbon sinks, but degradation due to climate change and human activity releases substantial amounts of stored carbon. Adding biochar – a charcoal-like material – to these ecosystems is a proposed strategy to enhance carbon storage.  Research is exploring the complex interplay between biochar, microbial communities, and peat formation to determine the efficacy and long-term sustainability of this approach.

Current research:  Soil science, biogeochemistry, ecology, carbon cycle research, material science (biochar production), ecosystem modelling.
