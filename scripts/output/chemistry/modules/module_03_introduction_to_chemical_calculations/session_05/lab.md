**Lab Focus: Limiting Reactants**

**1. Brief Background:**

This laboratory exercise directly builds upon the lecture material concerning stoichiometric calculations and the concept of limiting reactants. Understanding the mole concept and balanced chemical equations is crucial. This experiment will allow students to experimentally identify the limiting reactant in a reaction, mirroring the theoretical approach discussed, and then apply this knowledge to calculate the percent yield of the reaction. The goal is to solidify the connection between theoretical stoichiometry and real-world chemical processes.

**2. Lab Objectives:**

*   Calculate the number of moles of each reactant, 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O, using their masses.
*   Identify the limiting reactant in the reaction.
*   Calculate the theoretical yield of water (H₂O) based on the limiting reactant.
*   Determine the actual yield of water based on experimental measurements.
*   Calculate the percent yield of the reaction.

**3. Materials and Equipment:**

*   Hydrogen Gas (H₂) – 2.0 M solution in distilled water, 100 mL
*   Distilled Water (250 mL)
*   Oxygen Gas (O₂) – 3.0 M solution in distilled water, 100 mL
*   Beakers (250 mL) – 3
*   Graduated Cylinders (50 mL and 100 mL)
*   Electronic Balance (accurate to 0.01 g)
*   Thermometer (0-100°C, 1°C resolution)
*   Stopwatch
*   Ring Stand and Clamp
*   Test Tube
*   Test Tube Rack
*   Safety Goggles
*   Gloves (Nitrile)
*   Lab Coat

**4. Safety Considerations:**

⚠️ **Hydrogen Gas Hazard:** Hydrogen gas is flammable and explosive. Avoid open flames and sparks. Perform the reaction in a well-ventilated area.
⚠️ **Oxygen Gas Hazard:** Oxygen gas supports combustion. Avoid contact with flammable materials.
⚠️ **Eye Protection:** Wear safety goggles at all times.
⚠️ **Skin Contact:** Avoid skin contact with solutions. If contact occurs, immediately flush with water.
⚠️ **Gloves:** Wear nitrile gloves to prevent skin contact.
⚠️ **PPE:** All students must wear a lab coat.

**5. Procedure:**

1.  **Preparation:** Don safety goggles and gloves.
2.  **Reaction Setup:** Add 50.0 mL of 2.0 M H₂ solution and 50.0 mL of 3.0 M O₂ solution to separate 250 mL beakers.
3.  **Reaction Initiation:** Using a stopwatch, begin timing the reaction. Gently swirl each beaker.
4.  **Observation:** Observe the reaction in both beakers. Note any changes in color, temperature increase, or gas evolution. Record these observations in the data table.
5.  **Temperature Measurement:** Monitor and record the temperature of each solution every 30 seconds for 5 minutes.
6.  **Reaction Termination:** Stop the reaction by adding 5 mL of cold distilled water to each beaker. Swirl gently and observe.

**6. Data Collection:**

**7. Analysis Questions:**

1.  Which reactant was the limiting reactant? Justify your answer based on your data.
2.  Explain the significance of the temperature increase observed in the reaction.
3.  How did the control beaker (distilled water only) serve as a reference for this experiment?
4.  What factors could have contributed to any discrepancies between the theoretical yield and the actual yield?
5.  Relate your observations to the concept of a balanced chemical equation and stoichiometry.

**8. Expected Results:**

Students should observe a vigorous reaction in the beaker containing H₂ and O₂, characterized by bubbling (gas evolution) and a significant temperature increase. The control beaker should remain at room temperature (approximately 22°C) with minimal changes. The temperature change indicates the exothermic nature of the reaction. The reaction will generate water (H₂O) as a product.
