## Research Question 1: How does the concentration of a reactant influence the rate of a chemical reaction?

**Methodology:** This investigation will explore the relationship between reactant concentration and reaction rate. We will use the rate law for a simple reaction (e.g., the reaction between sodium thiosulfate and hydrochloric acid).  The reaction will be carried out in a controlled environment, maintaining a constant temperature.  We will prepare a series of solutions with varying concentrations of the sodium thiosulfate. For each solution, we will measure the time taken for a visible endpoint to be reached (the time it takes for a yellow precipitate to appear). We'll meticulously record the time taken for each trial. Data will be collected across a range of concentrations, and calculations will be performed to determine the rate constant (k) for the reaction at each concentration.  Statistical analysis (e.g., calculating standard deviations) will be used to determine the reliability of the rate constant values. The temperature will be carefully monitored and maintained throughout the experiment.

**Expected Outcomes:**  We anticipate observing a direct relationship between the concentration of sodium thiosulfate and the reaction rate.  As the concentration increases, the reaction rate should also increase. We will obtain a rate constant (k) that demonstrates this relationship.  The standard deviation of the rate constant values will provide an indication of the precision of our measurements.  The data will be used to demonstrate the principles of rate laws and the impact of reactant concentration on reaction kinetics.  This investigation will also highlight the importance of controlled experimental conditions in accurately determining reaction rates.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of temperature on the rate of a catalyzed reaction?

**Methodology:** This investigation will examine the impact of temperature on the rate of a catalyzed reaction – specifically, the hydrolysis of an ester (e.g., ethyl acetate) using a catalyst (e.g., sodium ethoxide).  Several solutions of the ester will be prepared at a constant concentration. These solutions will be placed in water baths maintained at different temperatures (e.g., 20°C, 30°C, 40°C, and 50°C). The rate of hydrolysis will be monitored by measuring the amount of acetic acid produced, using titration with a standardized base. Titrations will be performed at consistent intervals to assess the change in acidity. Careful measurements of pH will also be recorded. Data collection will be performed in triplicate to ensure the reliability of the results. Precise temperature control will be maintained throughout the experiment, and any fluctuations will be recorded.

**Expected Outcomes:** We hypothesize that increasing the temperature will increase the reaction rate.  The rate constant (k) should increase with temperature, demonstrating the Arrhenius relationship. The data will illustrate how temperature affects the kinetic energy of molecules, leading to more frequent and energetic collisions, and therefore, a faster reaction rate. This investigation will provide a practical example of the Arrhenius equation and its significance in chemical kinetics.

## Research Question 3: How can we accurately measure the volume of a gas produced in a reaction?

**Methodology:** This investigation will focus on measuring the volume of carbon dioxide produced during the reaction between hydrochloric acid and calcium carbonate. A known mass of calcium carbonate will be added to a volumetric flask containing a known volume of hydrochloric acid. The reaction will be conducted in a closed system (e.g., a reaction vessel with a gas collection apparatus). The carbon dioxide gas produced will be collected over water (to prevent atmospheric contamination). The volume of gas collected will be determined by measuring the displacement of the water in the gas collection apparatus. A water displacement method will be employed. The experiment will be conducted at a constant temperature and pressure to minimize the impact of these variables. The experiment will be repeated multiple times to ensure reliability and precision.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate obtaining a reasonably accurate measurement of the volume of carbon dioxide produced. The collected volume will be used to calculate the moles of CO2 produced, and subsequently, the moles of calcium carbonate reacted. This will allow us to determine the stoichiometry of the reaction. Furthermore, the experiment will demonstrate the principles of gas laws and their applications in chemical analysis. The accuracy of the volume measurement will be assessed by comparing it with the theoretical value obtained from the balanced chemical equation.
