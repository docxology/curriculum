**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Which of the following best describes the concept of stoichiometry?
A) The study of chemical reactions at high temperatures
B) The quantitative relationship between reactants and products in a chemical reaction
C) The process of separating mixtures using distillation
D) The measurement of pH in a solution?
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Stoichiometry focuses on the quantitative relationships between reactants and products based on balanced chemical equations, allowing for precise calculations.

**Question 3:**  If a reaction has a theoretical yield of 100 grams and an actual yield of 80 grams, what is the percent yield of the reaction?
A) 20%
B) 80%
C) 100%
D) 50%
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Percent yield is calculated as (actual yield / theoretical yield) * 100. In this case, (80/100)*100 = 80%, indicating the reaction achieved 80% of the expected product.

**Question 4:**  What is the purpose of a limiting reactant in a chemical reaction?
A) It's the reactant that is present in excess.
B) It’s the reactant that completely determines the amount of product formed.
C) It represents the catalyst in the reaction.
D) It’s the solvent used to dissolve the reactants.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The limiting reactant is consumed first, dictating the maximum amount of product that can be formed based on the balanced chemical equation.

**Question 5:**  Which of the following is NOT a key component of balancing chemical equations?
A) Maintaining the same number of atoms on both sides
B) Adjusting coefficients to ensure the equation is balanced
C) Altering the molecular formulas of the reactants
D) Ensuring the same number of moles of each element?
**Answer:** D
**Explanation:** Balancing equations involves adjusting coefficients to equate the number of atoms of each element on both sides, not changing the number of moles.

**Question 6:**  Describe the role of a catalyst in a chemical reaction?
**Answer:** A catalyst speeds up a chemical reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy. It is not consumed in the reaction itself, and it does not affect the equilibrium position. Key points: It lowers the activation energy, increases the rate of reaction, and is regenerated during the process.

**Question 7:**  Explain how the mole concept relates to the mass of a chemical substance?
**Answer:** The mole concept connects the macroscopic world (mass) to the microscopic world (number of particles).  The mole represents a specific number of particles (Avogadro's number), allowing us to convert between mass, number of particles, and volume using molar mass. Key points: Molar mass provides the conversion factor.

**Question 8:**  Suppose you are performing a reaction and observe that all of the limiting reactant is used up. What does this indicate about the reaction’s progress?
**Answer:** This indicates that the reaction has proceeded to completion, meaning that all of the limiting reactant has been converted into products according to the stoichiometry of the balanced equation. Key points: It means no unreacted limiting reactant remains.

**Question 9:**  Define the term "theoretical yield" in the context of a chemical reaction?
**Answer:** Theoretical yield represents the maximum possible amount of product that can be formed from a complete reaction based on the balanced chemical equation and the amount of limiting reactant useD) Key points: It’s a calculated value, not an experimentally obtained one.

**Question 10:**  How does the concept of percent yield relate to the efficiency of a chemical reaction?
**Answer:** Percent yield reflects the efficiency of a reaction; a higher percent yield signifies a greater proportion of the theoretical yield that was actually obtaineD) A lower yield indicates that some of the reaction did not proceed to completion, possibly due to side reactions or incomplete conversion. Key points: It’s a measure of the reaction’s success.
