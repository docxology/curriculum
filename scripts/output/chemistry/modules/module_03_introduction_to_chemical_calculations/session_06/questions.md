**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Which of the following best describes a balanced chemical equation?
A) A description of a chemical reaction
B) An equation that violates the law of conservation of mass
C) An equation that represents the complete conversion of reactants to products, with equal numbers of atoms of each element on both sides.
D) A diagram illustrating the arrangement of atoms in a molecule.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** A balanced equation maintains the law of conservation of mass by ensuring that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides, reflecting the conservation of mass during a chemical reaction.

**Question 3:** What is the mole concept primarily used for in stoichiometry?
A) Determining the color of a chemical solution
B) Relating the mass of a substance to its number of particles
C) Measuring the temperature of a chemical reaction
D) Separating different components of a mixture
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The mole concept allows us to relate the mass of a substance to the number of molecules or atoms it contains, enabling us to perform quantitative calculations in chemical reactions.

**Question 4:**  If a reaction has a yield of 85%, what does this indicate?
A) The reaction produced 100% of the theoretical product.
B) The actual product obtained is less than the theoretical maximum amount.
C) The reaction was performed under ideal conditions.
D) The reaction was reversible.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** A yield of 85% indicates that 85% of the reactant was converted to product, while the remaining 15% was lost or unreacted, representing the difference between the theoretical yield and the actual yield.

**Question 5:**  What unit is most commonly used to express the amount of a substance in chemical reactions?
A) Grams
B) Liters
C) Moles
D) Celsius
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The mole is a fundamental unit in chemistry, representing a specific number of particles (atoms, molecules, ions), and is used to relate mass to the amount of substance involved in chemical reactions.

**Question 6:**  A student performs a titration and determines the concentration of an unknown acid. What fundamental principle is the titration based on?
A)  The color change of a reactant.
B)  The neutralization reaction between an acid and a base.
C)  The measurement of temperature during the reaction.
D)  The separation of compounds using distillation.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Titration relies on the neutralization reaction between an acid and a base, where the endpoint is determined by the complete reaction of one reactant with the other, allowing for accurate concentration measurement.

**Question 7:**  What is the significance of balancing a chemical equation?
A) It changes the chemical formula of the reactants and products.
B) It ensures the correct stoichiometric ratios between reactants and products are represented.
C) It determines the color of the reaction mixture.
D) It eliminates the need for any calculations.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Balancing an equation ensures the law of conservation of mass is upheld, accurately representing the ratio of atoms of each element involved in the reaction.

**Question 8:**  A student measures 25.0 grams of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃). How many moles of NaHCO₃ does this represent? (Molar mass of NaHCO₃ = 84.01 g/mol)?
A) 0.200 moles
B) 0.300 moles
C) 0.700 moles
D) 84.01 moles
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:**  Moles = mass / molar mass = 25.0 g / 84.01 g/mol = 0.300 moles, demonstrating the conversion of mass to moles using the molar mass.

**Question 9:**  Why is it important to use proper units when performing stoichiometric calculations?
A) Units only affect the appearance of the final answer.
B) Incorrect units can lead to significant errors in the calculated results.
C) Units are only necessary for complex calculations.
D) Units are primarily used for labeling glassware.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Utilizing consistent units is crucial to ensure accurate calculations, as unit conversion errors can drastically alter the results and invalidate the outcome of the problem.

**Question 10:**  A researcher wants to determine the theoretical yield of a reaction.  What does 'theoretical yield' represent?
A) The actual amount of product obtained after a reaction.
B) The maximum amount of product that can be formed, assuming perfect conditions and complete conversion.
C) The amount of unreacted reactant remaining after the reaction.
D) The amount of waste generated during the reaction.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Theoretical yield is the calculated maximum amount of product that can be formed from a given amount of reactant, based on the balanced equation and complete conversion – a theoretical outcome.
