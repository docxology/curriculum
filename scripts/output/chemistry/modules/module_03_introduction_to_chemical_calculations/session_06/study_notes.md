## Introduction to Chemical Calculations

Welcome back to our module on Introduction to Chemical Calculations. In the previous sessions, we’ve established the fundamental building blocks: balancing chemical equations and understanding the concept of a chemical reaction. Now, we’re moving beyond simply writing out equations; we’re going to learn how to *solve* problems using these equations. Chemical calculations are essentially quantitative exercises – we’re taking information given in a problem and using it to predict the amount of a substance involved. Think of it like a puzzle, and balancing equations is like having the initial pieces correctly arranged. This session will focus specifically on reaction problem-solving, a cornerstone skill in chemistry. We’ll systematically approach these problems, emphasizing the crucial role of the mole concept.
