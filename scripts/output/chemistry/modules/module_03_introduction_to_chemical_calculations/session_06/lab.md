**Lab Number: 6 – Applying the Mole Concept**

**1. Brief Background (98 words)**

This laboratory exercise directly applies the concepts introduced in today’s lecture on introduction to chemical calculations. Students will solidify their understanding of stoichiometry by solving a practical problem involving the quantitative relationships between reactants and products. The core of the exercise centers around utilizing the balanced chemical equation to calculate the amount of a product formed from a given amount of reactant. Precision and attention to unit conversions, key elements of the lecture, will be emphasized throughout the experiment. Successfully completing this lab will foster a deeper understanding of the mole concept and its role in quantitative chemical analysis.

**2. Lab Objectives (4 bullet points)**

*   Calculate the number of moles of a reactant given its mass.
*   Use a balanced chemical equation to determine the theoretical yield of a product.
*   Convert between grams and moles using molar mass.
*   Perform stoichiometric calculations to predict the amount of product formed.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHCO₃), 50.0 g
*   Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), 1.0 M solution (250 mL)
*   Distilled Water, 100 mL
*   Beakers (250 mL), 3
*   Graduated Cylinders (50 mL, 100 mL)
*   Electronic Balance (±0.001 g)
*   Stirring Rods (glass)
*   Thermometer (0-100°C, 1°C resolution)
*   Safety Goggles
*   Lab Apron

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

*   **Chemical Hazard:** Hydrochloric acid is corrosive. Avoid contact with skin and eyes. In case of contact, immediately flush with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes and seek medical attention.
*   **Physical Hazard:** Glassware can break. Handle beakers and graduated cylinders with care. Dispose of broken glassware in designated containers.
*   **PPE Requirements:**  Wear safety goggles *at all times* during the experiment. Lab aprons are required to protect clothing.
*   **Time-Sensitive Step:** Addition of HCl should be done slowly with constant stirring to prevent excessive heat generation.

**5. Procedure (6 steps)**

1.  Weigh out 50.0 g of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) using the electronic balance. Record the exact mass in grams in Table 1.
2.  Add 100 mL of 1.0 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution to one 250 mL beaker.
3.  Slowly add the HCl solution to the beaker while simultaneously stirring with a glass stirring rod. Maintain the temperature of the solution below 30°C using room temperature water if necessary.
4.  While stirring continuously, slowly add 100 mL of distilled water to the beaker.
5.  Carefully add the 50.0 g of NaHCO₃ to the beaker, continuing to stir. Observe the reaction.
6.  Record the final temperature of the solution in Table 1.

**6. Data Collection**

| Observation            | Data            |
| ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Initial NaHCO₃ Mass (g) | [INSERT VALUE]  |
| Final Temperature (°C) | [INSERT VALUE]  |
| Volume of HCl (mL)     | 100             |
| Volume of Water (mL)   | 100             |
| Description of Reaction | [INSERT TEXT] |

**7. Analysis Questions (4 questions)**

1.  Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sodium bicarbonate and hydrochloric acid.
2.  What is the molar mass of NaHCO₃? Calculate the number of moles of NaHCO₃ used in this experiment.
3.  Based on the balanced equation, what is the theoretical yield of carbon dioxide (CO₂) produced in this reaction?
4.  Explain how the mole concept relates to the amount of product (CO₂) formed during the experiment.

**8. Expected Results (3 observations)**

*   Students should observe vigorous bubbling and effervescence (formation of gas) during the reaction.  This indicates the formation of carbon dioxide.
*   The final temperature of the solution will likely increase due to the exothermic nature of the reaction (heat is released).
*   The theoretical yield of carbon dioxide will be calculated based on the stoichiometry of the balanced equation and the number of moles of NaHCO₃ used. The calculations will align with the theoretical yield derived from the balanced equation.
