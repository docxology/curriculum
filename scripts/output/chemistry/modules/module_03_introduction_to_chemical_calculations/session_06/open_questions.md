## Open Question 1: What is the proposed mechanism for the catalytic degradation of microplastics using marine-derived enzymes?

Context:  Microplastic pollution is a global crisis, and traditional degradation methods are slow and energy-intensive. Research is focusing on leveraging marine enzymes – specifically, metalloproteases – to accelerate the breakdown of these plastics. Understanding the precise catalytic mechanism, including enzyme-plastic interactions and intermediate formation, is crucial for optimizing this bioremediation strategy. Current research utilizes advanced spectroscopic techniques (Raman, FTIR) and computational modeling to elucidate this process.

## Open Question 2: How does the gut microbiome composition influence the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in treating Clostridioides difficile infection?

Context:  FMT is increasingly used to combat recurrent *C. difficile* infections, but the success rate varies significantly. Emerging research suggests that the recipient’s pre-existing gut microbiome profoundly impacts the outcome.  Specifically, the presence or absence of certain bacterial taxa – particularly those with butyrate-producing capabilities – appears to influence the ability of the transplanted microbiome to effectively suppress the pathogen. Current research utilizes 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomic analysis to correlate microbiome profiles with treatment response.

## Open Question 3: What are the implications of CRISPR-based gene editing for enhancing the resilience of coral reefs to ocean acidification?

Context:  Ocean acidification, driven by increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, poses a severe threat to coral reefs.  Researchers are investigating CRISPR-Cas systems to modify coral genes, enhancing their ability to cope with lower pH levels. Specifically, attempts are being made to upregulate the expression of genes involved in calcification and stress resistance.  However, potential off-target effects and the long-term ecological consequences of these interventions remain a key area of investigation – current research employs advanced genomic sequencing and ecological modeling to assess these impacts.
