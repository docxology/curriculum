## Research Question 1: How does the concentration of a catalyst affect the rate of a chemical reaction?

**Methodology:** This investigation will explore the influence of catalyst concentration on reaction rate. We will use the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate as a model reaction, known for its sensitivity to catalytic effects.  A controlled experiment will be conducted with varying concentrations of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a common base catalyst, dissolved in a solution of ethyl acetate.  The reaction rate will be monitored by measuring the volume of carbon dioxide gas produced over a fixed time interval.  The volume of CO₂ generated will be directly proportional to the reaction rate.  The experiment will be repeated three times for each concentration to ensure data reliability.  The data will be analyzed using regression analysis to determine the correlation between catalyst concentration and reaction rate.  Temperature will be carefully controlled and maintained constant throughout the experiment to eliminate temperature as a confounding variable.  Data will be presented graphically.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that increasing the catalyst concentration will initially increase the reaction rate, demonstrating an accelerating effect. However, this relationship is likely to exhibit diminishing returns – the increase in reaction rate will become smaller with each subsequent increase in catalyst concentration.  We expect to observe a curve where the rate increases with concentration, but the slope of the curve will decrease as the concentration increases.  This will demonstrate the principle of catalytic efficiency. A statistical analysis will determine a clear relationship between catalyst concentration and reaction rate, allowing us to quantify the effect. Furthermore, the experiment will provide valuable insights into the complex relationship between reaction rate and catalyst concentration, highlighting the importance of optimization.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of substrate concentration on enzyme activity?

**Methodology:** This investigation will examine the impact of substrate concentration on enzyme activity, using the enzyme catalase and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) as the model system. Catalase, an enzyme that decomposes H₂O₂ into water and oxygen, will be the primary focus.  A series of experiments will be conducted with varying concentrations of H₂O₂ solutions. The volume of oxygen gas produced – a direct byproduct of the reaction – will be measured as an indicator of enzyme activity. The oxygen gas volume will be meticulously measured using an inverted graduated cylinder submerged in water.  Each experiment will be repeated at least three times to ensure the repeatability and reliability of the data.  The reaction rate will be calculated from the volume of oxygen produced over a fixed time period.  Temperature will be rigorously controlled throughout the experiment to minimize its influence on enzyme activity.  Appropriate dilutions of H₂O₂ will be prepared to ensure accurate and consistent measurements.  A standard curve relating oxygen produced to concentration will be constructed for validation.

**Expected Outcomes:** We predict a positive correlation between substrate (H₂O₂) concentration and enzyme activity (reaction rate) – initially.  As substrate concentration increases, the rate of the reaction will accelerate due to more frequent enzyme-substrate collisions. However, we anticipate that at higher concentrations, the enzyme will eventually reach saturation, meaning that all available active sites are occupied. Beyond this point, increasing substrate concentrations will no longer increase the reaction rate because the enzyme is working at its maximum capacity.  The results will demonstrate the concept of enzyme saturation and provide a quantitative understanding of enzyme kinetics. The data will allow us to determine the Km (Michaelis constant) and Vmax (maximum velocity) of the enzyme.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the effectiveness of a filtration system in removing particulate matter?

**Methodology:** This investigation will assess the efficiency of a simple filtration system – a series of filter papers of varying pore sizes – in removing particulate matter from a turbid water solution. The turbidity of the water, which is a measure of its cloudiness due to suspended particles, will be quantified using a turbidity tube. A standard water solution will be prepared with known levels of suspended particles (e.g., clay or silt). The turbidity of this solution will be measured using a turbidity tube.  The turbidity tube will be used to measure the turbidity after passing the solution through each filter paper.  The turbidity of the water will be recorded.  The filtration process will be repeated with each filter paper, and the resulting turbidity will be measured for each. A control group of unfiltered water will be set up as a comparison point. The volume of water filtered through each filter paper will also be recorded. The effectiveness of each filter paper will be quantified by the reduction in turbidity achieved.

**Expected Outcomes:** We expect that filter papers with smaller pore sizes will be more effective at removing particulate matter – a direct result of the physical barrier they provide.  Initially, as the filter paper pore size decreases, the turbidity of the filtered water will decrease. However, we anticipate that beyond a certain point, the filter paper will become clogged with trapped particles, reducing its permeability and ultimately diminishing its filtration effectiveness.  The efficiency of each filter paper will be determined based on the degree of turbidity reduction. The results will demonstrate a clear relationship between filter pore size and the level of particulate matter removed. The data can be presented graphically to visually illustrate the filtration process.
