Okay, here’s a set of three research questions designed for undergraduate students, formatted as requested, with approximate word counts. I’ve focused on creating questions that leverage the provided information and context.

## Research Question 1: How does the rate of heating affect the melting point of ice?

**Methodology:** This investigation will use a calorimeter (a simple insulated container) to measure the temperature change of a known mass of ice at various heating rates. We will use a thermometer to precisely track the temperature changes.  We will carefully record the time it takes to reach specific temperature milestones (e.g., 10°C, 20°C, 30°C). Three trials will be conducted for each heating rate (e.g., 5°C/minute, 10°C/minute, 15°C/minute) with a small ice sample (approximately 50g) to minimize heat loss to the surroundings.  Data will be recorded in a table, and a graph will be constructed plotting heating rate versus melting point.  Potential sources of error will be considered, such as inaccurate temperature readings and heat loss to the environment.

**Expected Outcomes:** We anticipate that increasing the heating rate will lead to a lower observed melting point of the ice. This is because a faster heating rate generates more heat energy in a shorter time, potentially reaching the ice’s melting point before the entire mass has warmed. The graph will visually demonstrate this relationship.  The results will provide a tangible understanding of the concept of heat transfer and its influence on phase transitions, aligning with the principles of thermodynamics. We expect slight variations between the trials due to measurement inaccuracies. (Approximately 180 words)

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of water purity on the boiling point of water?

**Methodology:** This investigation will explore the influence of water purity on the boiling point of water. We will use a precisely calibrated thermometer and a controlled heating setup (e.g., a heating mantle). We will prepare three water samples: distilled water (considered highly pure), tap water (representing a more impure source), and filtered tap water. For each sample, we will measure the temperature at which it reaches a stable boiling point (100°C under standard atmospheric pressure). Three trials will be conducted for each water type, and the data will be recorded meticulously. We will carefully account for potential external factors such as air currents and ambient temperature. The data collected will be used to generate a comparative analysis of the impact of impurities on the boiling point. (Approximately 200 words)

## Research Question 3: How can we accurately measure the specific heat capacity of a metal using heat transfer principles?

**Methodology:** This investigation will determine the specific heat capacity of a metal sample (e.g., aluminum or copper) using a quantitative method involving heat transfer. We’ll start with a known mass of the metal at a known temperature. This will be heated using a controlled heat source (like a hot plate) and then placed in thermal contact with a known mass of water, also at a known temperature. The temperature change of the water will be measured using a thermometer. Applying the principle of heat exchange (heat lost by the metal = heat gained by the water), we can calculate the specific heat capacity of the metal. We’ll perform three trials, recording all data accurately.  We'll account for heat losses and ensure the system is well insulated. (Approximately 190 words)
