**Module: Matter and Stoichiometry**
**Lab Number: 1**
**Lab Focus: States of Matter**

**1. Brief Background (98 words)**

This laboratory exercise builds upon the foundational concepts introduced in the lecture regarding matter and its states – solid, liquid, and gas. We will investigate the macroscopic properties that differentiate these states, directly relating to the arrangement and movement of particles. The ability to observe and classify changes in matter is crucial for understanding chemical reactions and stoichiometry. By conducting simple demonstrations and careful observations, students will gain a practical understanding of how the state of matter is determined by its properties, ultimately linking to the core principles of this module. [INSTRUCTOR: Briefly review kinetic molecular theory].

**2. Lab Objectives (4 bullet points)**

*   Observe and describe the characteristics of solid, liquid, and gaseous states.
*   Determine the shape and volume of substances in each state.
*   Compare and contrast the movement of particles within each state.
*   Classify provided substances based on their observed state.
*   Record precise observations regarding phase changes.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   **Substances:**
    *   Ice (approximately 100g)
    *   Distilled Water (500 mL)
    *   Rubbing Alcohol (70% Isopropyl Alcohol, 100 mL)
    *   Dry Ice (approximately 50g - *Caution: Requires separate handling procedures*)
    *   Small Clear Glass Beakers (3 x 250 mL)
    *   Small Clear Test Tubes (6)
*   **Equipment:**
    *   Thermometer (0-100°C, 1-degree resolution)
    *   Hot Plate
    *   Graduated Cylinders (10 mL, 50 mL)
    *   Safety Glasses (ANSI Z87.1)
    *   Gloves (Nitrile, Medium)
    *   Stirring Rods (Glass)
    *   Digital Scale (0-100g, 0.1g resolution)

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

*   **⚠️ Dry Ice:** Dry ice is extremely cold (-78.5°C) and can cause severe frostbite upon contact. Handle only with insulated gloves and tongs. Do not touch dry ice directly. Never ingest.  [INSTRUCTOR: Emphasize handling protocol].
*   **⚠️ Hot Plate:** Use caution when working with the hot plate. Avoid contact with hot surfaces. Wear safety glasses.
*   **⚠️ Rubbing Alcohol:** Flammable. Keep away from open flames. Avoid inhaling vapors.
*   **⚠️ General Lab Safety:** Wear ANSI Z87.1 safety glasses at all times.  Use gloves when handling any chemicals.  Dispose of materials properly according to [INSTRUCTOR: Specify waste disposal procedures].

**5. Procedure (6 steps)**

1.  **Observation of Ice:** Place a small piece of ice (approximately 10g) into a beaker. Observe its shape and volume. Record your observations in the data table.
2.  **Observation of Water:**  Pour 200 mL of distilled water into a second beaker. Observe its shape and volume.
3.  **Observation of Rubbing Alcohol:** Pour 50 mL of rubbing alcohol into a third beaker. Observe its shape and volume.
4.  **Phase Change with Dry Ice:** Slowly add 20g of dry ice to 100 mL of water in a test tube. Observe and record any changes (e.g., bubbling, temperature changes). Monitor the temperature with the thermometer.
5.  **Temperature Measurement:** Measure and record the initial temperature of the water before adding dry ice.  Record the final temperature after the dry ice has sublimated.
6. **Quantitative Measurement:** Weigh the dry ice before and after sublimation to calculate the mass lost (sublimated).

**6. Data Collection**

| Observation                      | Description                      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Ice                             | Shape: _______________ Volume: _______________ |
| Water                            | Shape: _______________ Volume: _______________ |
| Rubbing Alcohol                  | Shape: _______________ Volume: _______________ |
| Phase Change (Ice + Water)       |  Describe any observed changes (e.g., bubbling, color change, temperature change).   Temperature Change: _______ °C |
| Mass of Dry Ice (Initial)      | _______ g                     |
| Mass of Dry Ice (Final)          | _______ g                     |
| Mass Lost (Dry Ice)             | _______ g                     |

**7. Analysis Questions (4 questions)**

1.  Describe the movement of water molecules in liquid water.
2.  Explain why ice has a definite shape and volume, while liquid water does not.
3.  What evidence supports the idea that matter is composed of particles that are constantly in motion?
4.  How did the addition of dry ice to water demonstrate a change of state?

**8. Expected Results (Explanation)**

Students should observe that ice maintains a definite shape and volume. Liquid water takes the shape of its container but maintains a constant volume.  Rubbing alcohol will exhibit a similar behavior, maintaining its shape and volume.  The phase change with dry ice will result in the formation of solid carbon dioxide (snow) and a decrease in the temperature of the water. The mass loss of the dry ice will quantify the sublimation process. [INSTRUCTOR: Explain the concept of sublimation – a solid changing directly to a gas].
