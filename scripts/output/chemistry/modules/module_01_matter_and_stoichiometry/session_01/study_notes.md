## Key Concepts

## Matter and Stoichiometry

**Introduction**

Welcome to Module 1 of Matter and Stoichiometry. In our previous studies, we’ve explored basic physics and the concept of energy. Recall that energy exists in various forms – kinetic, potential, thermal – and is always conserved, though it can be transformed from one form to another. This module builds upon that foundation by introducing the fundamental building blocks of the universe: matter. Matter, simply put, is anything that has mass and occupies space. It’s the stuff everything around us is made of, from the air we breathe to the rocks beneath our feet. We’ll be focusing on understanding the different ways matter exists and how we can classify it. This session will establish the core concepts that govern our exploration of chemical reactions and quantitative relationships.

## States of Matter

Matter exists in several distinct states, each characterized by its unique physical properties. The three most commonly encountered states are solid, liquid, and gas. Let’s begin with a simple analogy: consider water. It can exist as ice (solid), water (liquid), or steam (gas), all of which share the same chemical formula – H₂O – but display drastically different behaviors.

*   **Solid**: Solid: In a solid state, the particles (atoms or molecules) are tightly packed together in a fixed arrangement, giving the substance a definite shape and volume. Think of a diamond – its rigid structure allows it to maintain its shape regardless of its environment. Solids maintain their shape because the particles are held in a stable, ordered arrangement.

*   **Liquid**: Liquid: Liquids have a fixed volume but take the shape of their container. The particles are still close together but have more freedom to move past one another. Imagine pouring water into a glass; it fills the glass, but it maintains a constant volume. The particles are still in contact but can move around.

*   **Gas**: Gas: Gases have neither a definite shape nor a definite volume; they expand to fill the available space. The particles are widely spaced and move randomly. Think of a balloon – it takes the shape of its container and expands if you increase the pressure.

## Physical vs. Chemical Changes

A **physical change** alters the form or appearance of a substance but *does not* change its chemical composition. Examples include melting ice (solid H₂O becomes liquid H₂O) or dissolving sugar in water.  The substance is still water, just in a different state.  Physical changes are often reversible.

A **chemical change** involves the formation of new substances with different chemical properties. This often involves a chemical reaction. Evidence of a chemical change includes the production of a gas (bubbles), a change in color, the formation of a precipitate (a solid that forms from a solution), or a change in temperature. For instance, burning wood involves a chemical reaction that produces ash, carbon dioxide, and water – substances fundamentally different from the original wood.

## Properties of Matter

**Physical Properties**: These are characteristics that can be observed or measured without changing the chemical composition of a substance. Examples include color, density, melting point, boiling point, hardness, and conductivity.

**Chemical Properties**: These describe a substance’s ability to undergo chemical reactions. They are revealed only when a chemical reaction occurs. Examples include flammability (the ability to burn), reactivity (how easily it reacts with other substances), and corrosiveness (the ability to damage or destroy other materials).
