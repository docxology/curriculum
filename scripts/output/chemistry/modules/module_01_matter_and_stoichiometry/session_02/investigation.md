are three research questions designed for undergraduate students, formatted according to the provided specifications and guidelines.

## Research Question 1: How Does the Neutron-to-Proton Ratio Impact the Stability of Uranium Isotopes?

**Methodology:** This investigation will explore the relationship between the neutron-to-proton ratio and the stability of uranium isotopes. Students will research the natural abundance of various uranium isotopes (e.g., 238U, 235U, 234U) and analyze the data. They’ll then utilize theoretical models to predict the stability of uranium isotopes with varying neutron-to-proton ratios. Research will involve examining nuclear physics literature, accessing publicly available databases (e.g., the National Nuclear Data Center), and potentially utilizing basic computational tools (e.g., spreadsheets) to model isotope decay rates. The investigation will culminate in a comparative analysis of the factors contributing to the long-term stability of uranium isotopes.  Students will also investigate the concept of "magic numbers" and their significance in nuclear stability.

**Expected Outcomes:** Students will demonstrate an understanding of nuclear stability, including the role of the neutron-to-proton ratio in influencing the longevity of atomic nuclei. They will be able to articulate the concept of "magic numbers" and explain why specific uranium isotopes are exceptionally stable compared to others. The research will provide insights into the fundamental principles governing nuclear behavior and the factors that determine nuclear decay rates. Students will produce a written report detailing their findings, incorporating relevant data, calculations, and conclusions.  (Approximately 185 words)

## Research Question 2: How Does the Effect of Radioactive Decay on Carbon-14 Isotopes Impact Radiocarbon Dating Techniques?

**Methodology:** This research will focus on the processes involved in radiocarbon dating. Students will research the radioactive decay of Carbon-14 (¹⁴C) and its half-life of approximately 5,730 years. The investigation will explore how the known decay rate is used to estimate the age of organic materials.  Students will analyze the mathematical principles behind the radiocarbon dating method, including the use of logarithms and exponential decay equations. Research will involve investigating how environmental factors, such as atmospheric carbon-14 concentrations and contamination, can impact the accuracy of dating results. Students will examine the processes used to correct for these factors and  explore the limitations of the method.  The investigation will culminate in a detailed description of the carbon dating process, its mathematical foundation, and the factors that influence its reliability. (Approximately 175 words)

## Research Question 3: How Can Mass Spectrometry Be Utilized to Analyze the Isotopic Composition of Geological Samples?

**Methodology:** This investigation will examine the application of mass spectrometry in geological sample analysis, specifically focusing on isotopic determination. Students will research the principles of mass spectrometry, including ion formation, separation based on mass-to-charge ratio, and the detection of individual isotopes. The research will focus on how mass spectrometry is used to determine the ratios of different isotopes (e.g., uranium, strontium, neodymium) in rocks and minerals. Students will investigate the process of sample preparation, including dissolving, extracting, and purifying the elements of interest. They will explore how the data obtained from mass spectrometry is interpreted to reconstruct past environmental conditions, such as ancient climates, tectonic plate movements, and weathering processes.  Students will research techniques related to geological dating and interpretation of data for specific geological contexts (e.g., paleomagnetism, argon-argon dating). (Approximately 190 words)
