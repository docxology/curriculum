## Matter and Stoichiometry

**Introduction**

Welcome back to the course on Matter and Stoichiometry. In our previous session, we began exploring the macroscopic properties of matter – its states, density, and how we measure quantities. Today, we’re taking a monumental leap in understanding matter by delving into its fundamental building block: the atom. While we observe matter in terms of its observable properties, at its core, everything we see, touch, and interact with is composed of incredibly tiny particles. This session will introduce you to the structure of the atom, focusing on the subatomic particles – protons, neutrons, and electrons – and how these particles contribute to an atom’s identity and behavior. Think of it like this: just as a house is built from bricks, beams, and mortar, matter is built from atoms. Understanding the structure of the atom is the first crucial step in understanding chemical reactions and the vast world of chemistry.

**Key Concepts**

**Nucleus**: The central core of an atom containing protons and neutrons. This region is incredibly dense and accounts for almost all of the atom's mass.
**Electron Shells**:  Regions surrounding the nucleus where electrons are located, organized into distinct energy levels. Electrons occupy these shells, and the arrangement of these shells dictates an atom’s chemical properties.
**Atomic Number**: The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom, which uniquely identifies an element.
**Mass Number**: The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom’s nucleus.

**Main Topic 1: The Components of the Atom**

The atom, as initially conceived, was considered to be indivisible – the smallest unit of matter. However, through advances in physics, particularly the work of J.J. Thomson and Ernest Rutherford, we’ve discovered that atoms are, in fact, composed of even smaller components.

### 1.1 Protons and Neutrons – The Nucleus

At the heart of every atom lies a dense, positively charged region called the **nucleus** ( **nucleus**: The central core of an atom containing protons and neutrons). This nucleus accounts for almost all of the atom’s mass. The nucleus is comprised of two types of subatomic particles: protons and neutrons.

*   **Protons**: These particles carry a positive electrical charge (+1) and contribute to the atom’s atomic number. The number of protons defines the element. For instance, all atoms with one proton are hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen is the simplest element and the most abundant in the universe.
*   **Neutrons**: These particles have no electrical charge (neutral) and also contribute to the atom's mass. Neutrons help stabilize the nucleus by mitigating the repulsive forces between the positively charged protons. Atoms of the same element with differing numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.

### 1.2 Isotopes

**Isotopes**: Atoms of the same element (same number of protons) but with varying numbers of neutrons. This variation in neutron number results in different mass numbers for the same element. For example, carbon-12 (¹²C) has six protons and six neutrons, while carbon-14 (¹⁴C) has six protons and eight neutrons. Both are isotopes of carbon, but they have different masses and nuclear properties.

### 1.3 Electron Shells

**Electron Shells**: Electrons do not orbit the nucleus in fixed paths like planets. Instead, they occupy specific regions around the nucleus called electron shells. These shells are defined by energy levels, with lower energy levels being closer to the nucleus.  Each shell can hold a maximum number of electrons. The first shell can hold up to 2 electrons, the second can hold up to 8, and so on. The arrangement of electrons within these shells dictates an atom’s chemical behavior.

**Electron Configuration**: The specific arrangement of electrons within the electron shells of an atom.  This configuration is crucial for determining how an atom will interact with other atoms in chemical reactions.

**Mnemonics:**
