## Lab Focus: Atomic Number, Mass Number

**Module: Matter and Stoichiometry**
**Lab Number: 2**
**Lab Focus: Atomic Number, Mass Number**

**1. Brief Background (87 words)**

This lab builds upon the introductory lecture’s exploration of atomic structure. We will investigate the fundamental properties of atoms by determining their atomic number and mass number. These values, derived from the number of protons and neutrons within an atom’s nucleus, are crucial for identifying elements and understanding their behavior in chemical reactions. Students will learn to use periodic table data to calculate these key parameters, reinforcing the connection between atomic structure and elemental identity.

**2. Lab Objectives (4 bullet points)**

*   Identify the number of protons in a given sample of an element.
*   Determine the mass number of an atom based on its number of protons and neutrons.
*   Calculate the atomic number of an element from its mass number and neutron number.
*   Compare and contrast different isotopes of the same element.
*   Record and analyze data accurately to determine atomic properties.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   Periodic Table of Elements (one per group)
*   Boron (B) Samples (5 grams each – 3 samples) – *Labeled clearly B1, B2, B3*
*   Carbon (C) Samples (5 grams each – 3 samples) – *Labeled clearly C1, C2, C3*
*   Hydrogen (H) Samples (5 grams each – 3 samples) – *Labeled clearly H1, H2, H3*
*   Analytical Balance (accurate to 0.001g)
*   Small Beakers (50mL)
*   Distilled Water (50mL)
*   Wash Bottle
*   Safety Goggles
*   Gloves (nitrile)
*   Waste Container (labeled “Radioactive Waste – Handle with Care”)

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

*   **⚠️Chemical Hazard:** Boron and Carbon samples may cause skin irritation. Avoid direct contact. Wash hands thoroughly after handling.
*   **⚠️Physical Hazard:** Analytical balance requires careful use; sudden movements can cause the balance to tip.
*   **⚠️PPE Required:** Wear safety goggles and gloves at all times during this experiment. [INSTRUCTOR] – Check that students are properly fitted with PPE.
*   **⚠️Time-Sensitive Step:** Accurately weighing samples must be completed within 15 minutes of sample delivery to maintain temperature control.
*   Dispose of all materials in the designated radioactive waste container.

**5. Procedure (6 steps)**

1.  Each group will select three different elements from the periodic table (e.g., Boron, Carbon, Hydrogen).
2.  Using the periodic table, identify the atomic number (number of protons) for each selected element. Record this number in your data table.
3.  Determine the mass number for each element. Mass number = Number of Protons + Number of Neutrons.  *Assume all elements have the same number of neutrons as the most common isotope*.
4.  Carefully weigh out 5.000g of each element sample using the analytical balance. Record the precise mass in your data table.
5.  Observe each element sample carefully. Note any differences in appearance (color, texture) in your data table.
6.  Clean and return all equipment to their designated locations. Ensure the balance is clean and dry before the next lab.

**6. Data Collection**

| Element | Atomic Number (Protons) | Mass Number (Protons + Neutrons) | Observed Appearance |
| :------ | :----------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| Boron    |                          |                                   |                     |
| Carbon   |                          |                                   |                     |
| Hydrogen |                          |                                   |                     |
| (Repeat for all 3 elements) |                          |                                   |                     |

**7. Analysis Questions (5 questions)**

1.  What is the relationship between the atomic number of an element and the number of protons in its nucleus?
2.  Explain how the mass number is determined and why it is an important property of an element.
3.  Why did we assume all samples had the same number of neutrons?  What is a more accurate method for determining the number of neutrons?
4.  If a sample had an atomic number of 6 and a mass number of 14, what element was it?
5.  How does knowing the atomic number and mass number of an element help us understand its chemical properties?

**8. Expected Results (Guidance)**

Students should observe slight variations in the appearance of the different elements. The analytical balance should accurately measure the sample mass within ±0.001g. Data collection should be recorded accurately to determine the atomic number and mass number of each element. Student responses to the analysis questions should demonstrate an understanding of the concepts related to atomic number, mass number, and isotopic variations.
