## Open Question 1: What is the mechanism of targeted gene editing using CRISPR-Cas13 for RNA degradation?

Context: CRISPR-Cas13 offers a unique approach to gene regulation by directly targeting RNA, providing temporal control that DNA editing lacks. However, precise control of degradation is a significant hurdle. Current research focuses on optimizing guide RNA design and Cas13 variants to minimize off-target effects and maximize RNA specificity.  Understanding the detailed mechanism of action is crucial for developing safer and more effective RNA therapeutics. Current research: Synthetic Biology, Gene Therapy, RNA Therapeutics

## Open Question 2: What is the role of quantum entanglement in enhancing sensor sensitivity for dark matter detection?

Context:  The elusive nature of dark matter necessitates incredibly sensitive detection methods. Researchers are exploring the potential of quantum entanglement to dramatically improve sensor sensitivity by correlating the properties of entangled particles. This concept hinges on the possibility of exploiting correlated measurements to surpass classical limitations. Current research: Quantum Sensors, Dark Matter Detection, Quantum Information Science

## Open Question 3: What are the implications of advanced AI-driven simulations for predicting the behavior of fusion plasmas?

Context: Achieving sustained nuclear fusion requires exquisitely controlled plasma behavior within a tokamak reactor. Traditional simulations are limited by computational power. Advanced AI models – particularly those leveraging deep learning – are being developed to accelerate and improve the accuracy of these simulations, predicting instabilities and optimizing reactor designs.  The ability to accurately model these complex systems is paramount to realizing fusion energy. Current research: Plasma Physics, Artificial Intelligence, Numerical Simulation
