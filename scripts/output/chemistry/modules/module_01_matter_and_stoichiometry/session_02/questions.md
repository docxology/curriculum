**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Explain the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?
**Answer:** Prokaryotic cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles, while eukaryotic cells have both. Prokaryotes are generally smaller and simpler in structure.

**Question 3:** Which subatomic particle contributes the most to an atom’s mass?
A) Electron
B) Proton
C) Neutron
D) Photon
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Neutrons have a mass of approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu), significantly more than protons (1 amu) or electrons (negligible mass), and therefore contribute the most to an atom's overall mass.

**Question 4:** Isotopes of an element have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. What does this difference in neutron number primarily affect?
A) The element’s atomic number
B) The element’s chemical properties
C) The element’s mass number
D) The element’s electrical charge
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:**  Isotopes have the same number of protons (defining the element) but varying neutron numbers, leading to differences in mass and, consequently, slight variations in their chemical behavior.

**Question 5:** What is the significance of the atomic number of an element?
A) It represents the element’s mass.
B) It determines the number of neutrons in the nucleus.
C) It defines the element’s identity and the number of protons.
D) It indicates the element's stability.
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The atomic number, defined by the number of protons, uniquely identifies an element and represents the fundamental building block of its atomic structure.

**Question 6:** Describe the process of determining the atomic number of an unknown element using mass spectrometry.?
**Answer:** Mass spectrometry involves ionizing the element, separating the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio, and then measuring the abundance of each isotope. This data allows scientists to determine the relative abundance of each isotope, which in turn reveals the element’s atomic number based on the dominant isotope present.

**Question 7:**  A sample of Boron (B) has an atomic mass of approximately 10.8 amu. How many neutrons are likely present in a typical Boron atom?

**Answer:** Approximately 5 neutrons. (Calculated by subtracting the atomic number (5) from the mass number (10.8 amu)).

**Question 8:**  Explain how the periodic table organizes elements, specifically relating to the concept of atomic number.?
**Answer:** The periodic table is organized by increasing atomic number, reflecting the fundamental difference in the number of protons within an atom. This arrangement reveals periodic trends in element properties, demonstrating how these relationships are linked to the elemental composition.

**Question 9:**  Suppose you are given an atom with 17 protons, 18 neutrons, and 18 electrons. What is the element's mass number?
**Answer:** 35. (Calculated by adding the number of protons and neutrons: 17 + 18 = 35)

**Question 10:**  Discuss the role of Ernest Rutherford’s gold foil experiment in our understanding of atomic structure.?
**Answer:** Rutherford's experiment, involving the deflection of alpha particles through a gold foil, provided crucial evidence for the existence of a small, dense, positively charged nucleus at the atom's center. This challenged the previously held idea of a diffuse, positive charge throughout the atom.
