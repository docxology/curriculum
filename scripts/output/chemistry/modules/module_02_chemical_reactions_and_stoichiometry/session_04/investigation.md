Okay, here’s the set of research questions formatted according to your specifications. I’ve focused on creating questions suitable for undergraduate students and included a detailed methodology and expected outcomes for each.

## Research Question 1: How does the concentration of sodium bicarbonate affect the rate of carbon dioxide production in a chemical reaction?

**Methodology:**

This investigation will utilize a controlled experiment to determine the effect of sodium bicarbonate concentration on the rate of carbon dioxide production. We’ll construct a reaction vessel containing a fixed volume of distilled water and a small, measured amount of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate). The vessel will be connected to a gas collection apparatus – typically a graduated cylinder inverted in a water bath – to capture the released carbon dioxide.  The key independent variable is the sodium bicarbonate concentration, manipulated across three distinct levels: low (1g/L), medium (5g/L), and high (10g/L).  For each concentration, we will measure the volume of carbon dioxide collected over a fixed time period (e.g., 5 minutes). A control group, using distilled water only, will also be included.  Temperature will be carefully monitored and maintained throughout the experiment. We’ll record all measurements and observations meticulously.

**Expected Outcomes:**

We hypothesize that increasing sodium bicarbonate concentration will lead to an increase in the rate of carbon dioxide production, up to a certain point. The data collected will be analyzed using graphs (e.g., volume of CO2 vs. concentration) to visually represent the relationship. We expect to observe an initial linear increase in the rate of CO2 production with increasing concentrations, but potentially a saturation point where further increases in concentration do not significantly impact the rate. The results will provide quantitative data to support or refute this hypothesis and will demonstrate the fundamental principles of chemical kinetics – specifically how reaction rate is influenced by reactant concentration.

## Research Question 2: What is the effect of varying the temperature on the rate of the reaction between hydrochloric acid and magnesium ribbon?

**Methodology:**

This investigation will explore the effect of temperature on the reaction rate between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and magnesium ribbon (Mg). We'll use three temperature levels: cold (approximately 5°C – achieved by placing the reaction vessel in an ice bath), room temperature (approximately 22°C), and warm (approximately 40°C – using a warm water bath). For each temperature, we'll carefully cut a known mass of magnesium ribbon and immediately add it to a fixed volume of HCl solution (e.g., 1M HCl). The reaction, which produces hydrogen gas, will be observed and measured. We’ll utilize a gas collection apparatus similar to the previous experiment. We’ll record the volume of hydrogen gas collected over a set time period (e.g., 5 minutes) for each temperature. It’s crucial to maintain strict control over the reaction environment.

**Expected Outcomes:**

We anticipate that increasing the temperature will accelerate the rate of the reaction between hydrochloric acid and magnesium ribbon. This is due to the collision theory - higher temperatures lead to more frequent and energetic collisions between the reactant molecules, thus increasing the probability of successful reactions. Data analysis will involve plotting volume of hydrogen gas (dependent variable) against temperature (independent variable). We expect to see a positive correlation – as temperature increases, the volume of hydrogen gas produced will also increase. This will allow us to demonstrate the impact of kinetic energy on chemical reaction rates.

## Research Question 3: How can we measure the concentration of hydrochloric acid using titration with sodium carbonate?

**Methodology:**

This investigation will focus on accurately determining the concentration of an unknown hydrochloric acid solution using titration with a standardized solution of sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃).  We’ll prepare a series of solutions of known concentration of sodium carbonate (e.g., 0.1M, 0.2M, 0.3M). We’ll then perform a titration experiment, carefully adding the sodium carbonate solution to the unknown hydrochloric acid solution until the reaction is complete. The reaction produces carbon dioxide, water, and sodium chloride. We will use an indicator (e.g., phenolphthalein) to visually signal the endpoint of the titration – the point at which all the hydrochloric acid has reacted with the sodium carbonate. We’ll record the volume of sodium carbonate solution added at the endpoint for each titration.  Each titration will be repeated at least three times to ensure accuracy and reliability.

**Expected Outcomes:**

Through precise titrations, we’ll be able to determine the concentration of the unknown hydrochloric acid solution. We will construct a standard curve relating the volume of sodium carbonate solution consumed to the corresponding concentration of sodium carbonate. This curve will then be used to calculate the concentration of the unknown hydrochloric acid solution based on its titration data. The results will demonstrate the principles of acid-base chemistry and the use of titrations for quantitative analysis – showcasing a practical application of chemical measurements.
