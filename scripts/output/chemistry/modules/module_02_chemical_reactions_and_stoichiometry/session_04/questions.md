**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:**  Which of the following best describes Avogadro’s Number?
A) The number of protons in an atom
B) The number of neutrons in an atom
C) The number of particles in one mole of a substance
D) The mass of one gram of a substance
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Avogadro’s number (6.022 x 10²³) represents the number of particles (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.) that are contained in exactly one mole of a substance, providing a standard unit of measurement.

**Question 3:**  What is the molar mass of water (H₂O)?
A) 18.02 g/mol
B) 17.00 g/mol
C) 34.01 g/mol
D) 1.00 g/mol
**Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Molar mass is calculated by adding the atomic masses of each element in the compound. Hydrogen (1.01 g/mol) and Oxygen (16.00 g/mol) result in a molar mass of 18.02 g/mol for water.

**Question 4:**  You have 10.0 grams of carbon dioxide (CO₂). How many moles of CO₂ do you have?
A) 0.10 mol
B) 0.34 mol
C) 1.00 mol
D) 0.50 mol
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Calculate the molar mass of CO₂ (approximately 44.01 g/mol), then divide the given mass (10.0 g) by the molar mass to determine the number of moles.

**Question 5:**  What is the relationship between grams and moles?
A) They are equivalent units
B) Moles are larger than grams
C) Grams are a measure of count, while moles are a measure of mass
D) They are inversely proportional
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Moles are a conversion factor between the macroscopic (grams) and microscopic (atoms/molecules) world. One mole of a substance represents a specific number of particles and a specific mass.

**Question 6:**  Briefly describe the significance of using the mole in chemical calculations?
**Answer:** The mole provides a convenient and consistent unit for expressing the amount of a substance. It bridges the gap between the microscopic world of atoms and molecules and the macroscopic quantities we measure in the lab, allowing for accurate stoichiometric calculations.

**Question 7:**  Explain the difference between a balanced chemical equation and an unbalanced chemical equation?
**Answer:** An unbalanced equation does not adhere to the law of conservation of mass, as it does not have the same number of molecules of reactants and products. A balanced equation, on the other hand, ensures that the number of atoms of each element is equal on both sides, reflecting the conservation of mass.

**Question 8:**  Considering the lab procedure, how does measuring the mass of sodium chloride to determine one mole connect to Avogadro’s number?
**Answer:** Measuring the mass of NaCl directly relates to the concept of the mole, as one mole of NaCl represents a specific mass (approximately 58.44 g). By knowing the mass and the molar mass, we can calculate the number of moles present.

**Question 9:**  Describe a real-world application where understanding molar mass is crucial.?
**Answer:** Molar mass is essential in determining the amount of reactants needed for a chemical reaction, ensuring the correct proportions for a successful synthesis or experiment – like calculating the amount of fertilizer required for a specific area of farmland.

**Question 10:**  Synthesize your understanding of Avogadro's number, molar mass, and the mole - how do these concepts work together to solve chemical problems?
**Answer:**  These concepts are interconnected, where Avogadro's number provides the quantity of particles in a mole, molar mass allows us to relate mass to the number of moles, and together they provide the tools to accurately perform stoichiometric calculations.
