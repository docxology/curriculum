## Lab 4: Avogadro’s Number

**1. Brief Background (98 words)**

This laboratory exercise directly builds upon our discussion of chemical reactions and stoichiometry, focusing on the fundamental unit of measurement – the mole. We’ve learned how balanced chemical equations represent reactions and the importance of reactants and products.  The mole provides a bridge between the microscopic world of atoms and molecules and the measurable quantities we use in the lab.  This experiment will allow you to directly observe and calculate the number of particles in a fixed mass of a substance, solidifying your understanding of Avogadro's Number and its connection to molar mass.

**2. Lab Objectives (4 bullet points)**

*   Determine the mass of 1.00 mole of sodium chloride (NaCl).
*   Calculate the number of moles present in a known mass of magnesium oxide (MgO).
*   Calculate the volume of 1.00 mole of carbon dioxide (CO₂) at standard temperature and pressure (STP).
*   Practice converting between grams, moles, and volume at STP.

**3. Materials and Equipment**

*   Sodium Chloride (NaCl), analytical grade
*   Magnesium Oxide (MgO), analytical grade
*   Carbon Dioxide (CO₂), dry ice (solid CO₂) – 100g
*   Electronic Balance (accurate to 0.001 g)
*   Digital Scale (accurate to 0.001 g)
*   Graduated Cylinder (100 mL)
*   Thermometer
*   Ice Bath (prepared water with ice)
*   Safety Goggles
*   Lab Coat
*   Gloves (Nitrile)

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

⚠️ **Chemical Hazard:** Dry ice is extremely cold and can cause frostbite upon contact. Handle with insulated tongs or gloves.
⚠️ **Physical Hazard:**  Dry ice sublimates (turns directly from solid to gas), producing carbon dioxide. Work in a well-ventilated area to prevent CO₂ build-up.  Avoid rapid sublimation.
⚠️ **Personal Protection:**  Always wear safety goggles, a lab coat, and nitrile gloves when handling dry ice or any chemicals. [INSTRUCTOR] – Monitor students carefully during dry ice handling.

**5. Procedure (6 steps)**

1.  **Part 1: NaCl Determination:** Using the electronic balance, accurately weigh out 40.00 g of sodium chloride (NaCl). Record the mass in the data table.
2.  **Part 1: NaCl Determination (continued):**  Calculate the number of moles of NaCl present using the molar mass of NaCl (approximately 58.44 g/mol). Record your calculation.
3.  **Part 2: MgO Determination:** Carefully weigh out 32.00 g of magnesium oxide (MgO). Record the mass in the data table.
4.  **Part 2: MgO Determination (continued):** Calculate the number of moles of MgO present using the molar mass of MgO (approximately 40.30 g/mol). Record your calculation.
5.  **Part 3: CO₂ Volume Determination:**  Place approximately 50 g of dry ice into the graduated cylinder.  Allow the dry ice to sublimate completely at room temperature.  Record the final volume of the gas in the graduated cylinder. [INSTRUCTOR] –  Ensure students understand the concept of sublimation.
6.  **Data Collection:**  Measure the temperature of the gas in the graduated cylinder using a thermometer.  Record this temperature.

**6. Data Collection (Table Template)**

| Substance       | Mass (g) | Moles (calculated) | Volume at STP (mL) | Temperature (°C) |
| :-------------- | :------- | :----------------- | :----------------- | :--------------- |
| NaCl           |          |                    |                    |                  |
| MgO             |          |                    |                    |                  |
| CO₂ (from dry ice) |          |                    |                    |                  |

**7. Analysis Questions (5 questions)**

1.  Explain the relationship between mass and moles based on your experimental results.
2.  How does Avogadro’s number relate to the number of particles in one mole of a substance?
3.  Why is it important to specify the conditions (e.g., STP) when dealing with volumes of gases?
4.  What are the potential sources of error in this experiment, and how might they affect your results?
5.  Describe how the calculated number of moles of NaCl relates to the concept of a ‘dozen’ in the context of Avogadro’s Number.

**8. Expected Results (4 points)**

Students should observe that 40.00 g of NaCl represents 1.00 mole of NaCl.  Similarly, 32.00 g of MgO will yield 1.00 mole. The volume of CO₂ produced by the sublimation of 50 g of dry ice at room temperature will be approximately 22.4 mL.  The temperature of the CO₂ gas should be close to 273 K (0 °C). [INSTRUCTOR] –  These are approximate values; minor deviations are acceptable.
