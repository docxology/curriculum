**Module: Chemical Reactions and Stoichiometry – Lab 3: Types of Reactions**

**Lab Number:** 3
**Lab Focus:** Types of Reactions

**1. Brief Background (87 words)**

This laboratory exercise builds upon our understanding of chemical equations and stoichiometry. We will synthesize and observe three distinct reaction types: single displacement, precipitation, and acid-base neutralization. Through careful observation and balanced equation writing, students will solidify their grasp of reactant and product identification and the conservation of mass, core principles introduced in the previous lecture. The experiment aims to translate theoretical knowledge into practical application, enabling a deeper comprehension of reaction dynamics.

**2. Lab Objectives:**

*   Write balanced chemical equations for three different reactions.
*   Identify each reaction type (single displacement, precipitation, acid-base) based on observed products.
*   Collect and analyze data to confirm the formation of precipitate and gas.
*   Demonstrate understanding of conservation of mass during the reactions.

**3. Materials and Equipment:**

*   **Chemicals:**
    *   2.0 M Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) – 50 mL
    *   Sodium Sulfate (Na₂SO₄) – 2.0 g
    *   Magnesium (Mg) – 1.0 g
    *   Copper(II) Chloride (CuCl₂) – 1.0 g
    *   Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) – 3.0 g
    *   Ammonia Solution (2.0 M) – 50 mL
    *   Distilled Water – 100 mL
*   **Equipment:**
    *   Beakers (100 mL, 250 mL) - 4
    *   Graduated Cylinders (10 mL, 25 mL) - 3
    *   Stirring Rods – 2
    *   Electronic Balance (accurate to 0.01 g)
    *   Hot Plate
    *   Thermometer
    *   Safety Goggles
    *   Gloves
    *   Waste Container (labeled for acidic waste)

**4. Safety Considerations (⚠️)**

⚠️ **Hazardous Chemicals:** Hydrochloric acid is corrosive. Avoid contact with skin and eyes.  Ammonia is a strong irritant.  Copper(II) Chloride solution can stain.
⚠️ **Thermal Hazards:** Use caution when heating solutions on a hot plate. Avoid rapid temperature changes.
⚠️ **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**  Wear safety goggles *at all times*.  Wear chemical-resistant gloves (nitrile recommended).  Lab coat required.
⚠️ **Waste Disposal:** All chemical waste must be disposed of in the designated waste container for acidic solutions.

**5. Procedure:**

1.  **Reaction 1: Single Displacement (Mg + CuCl₂)** – In a 100 mL beaker, add 2.0 g of Magnesium and 1.0 g of Copper(II) Chloride. Add 50 mL of distilled water. Stir until dissolved. Observe any changes.
2.  **Reaction 2: Precipitation (Na₂SO₄ + NH₃)** – In a 100 mL beaker, add 2.0 g of Sodium Sulfate to 50 mL of distilled water. Stir until dissolved.  Slowly add 50 mL of Ammonia solution while stirring. Observe for the formation of a white precipitate.
3.  **Reaction 3: Acid-Base Neutralization (HCl + NaHCO₃)** – In a 100 mL beaker, add 2.0 g of Sodium Bicarbonate to 50 mL of distilled water. Stir until dissolved. Slowly add 50 mL of 2.0 M Hydrochloric Acid while stirring. Observe for gas evolution (bubbling).
4.  Record all observations in the data table below.

**6. Data Collection:**

| Reaction | Reactants               | Observations                               | Temperature Change (°C) | Time (minutes) |
| :------- | :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :---------------------- | :------------- |
| 1        | Mg + CuCl₂              |                                            |                         |                 |
| 2        | Na₂SO₄ + NH₃           |                                            |                         |                 |
| 3        | HCl + NaHCO₃           |                                            |                         |                 |

**7. Analysis Questions:**

1.  Write a balanced chemical equation for each reaction observed.
2.  Identify the type of reaction occurring in each case. Justify your answer based on the products formed.
3.  Explain how the concept of conservation of mass is demonstrated in each reaction.
4.  If a precipitate forms in Reaction 2, describe the ions involved in the formation of the precipitate.
5.  What evidence indicated an acid-base neutralization reaction occurred in Reaction 3?

**8. Expected Results:**

*   **Reaction 1:**  Magnesium metal will react with Copper(II) Chloride to produce Copper metal and Magnesium Chloride.  The reaction may be slow and require slight heating.
*   **Reaction 2:** A white precipitate (likely ammonium sulfate) will form upon addition of Ammonia solution.
*   **Reaction 3:**  Bubbling (evolution of carbon dioxide gas) will be observed when Hydrochloric acid is added to Sodium Bicarbonate. The temperature may increase slightly.
