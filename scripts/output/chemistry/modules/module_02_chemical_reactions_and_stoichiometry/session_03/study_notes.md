## Chemical Reactions and Stoichiometry: Study Notes

**Introduction**

Welcome back to Chemical Reactions and Stoichiometry. This module focuses on understanding the language and principles governing chemical transformations. We’ll explore how to represent chemical reactions precisely and predict their outcomes. The core concept is utilizing balanced chemical equations to accurately depict these processes, guided by the fundamental principle of conservation of mass.

## Balancing Equations – A Closer Look

Balancing chemical equations ensures that the number of atoms of each element is equal on both sides, reflecting the conservation of mass. We achieve this by adding coefficients (numbers placed in front of chemical formulas) in front of the chemical formulas.

Example: Consider the reaction between hydrogen gas (H₂) and oxygen gas (O₂) to produce water (H₂O).

Unbalanced: H₂ + O₂ → H₂O

To balance:

1.  Count the atoms on each side:
    *   Left side: 2 H atoms, 2 O atoms
    *   Right side: 2 H atoms, 1 O atom
2.  Add a coefficient in front of H₂O to balance the oxygen atoms: H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O
3.  Now, count the atoms again:
    *   Left side: 2 H atoms, 2 O atoms
    *   Right side: 4 H atoms, 2 O atoms
4.  Add a coefficient in front of H₂ to balance the hydrogen atoms: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O

Now the equation is balanced: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O

This indicates that 2 molecules of hydrogen gas react with 1 molecule of oxygen gas to produce 2 molecules of water.

## Additional Points & Considerations

*   **States of Matter**: Chemical equations often include symbols to indicate the physical state of the substances (e.g., (s) for solid, (l) for liquid, (g) for gas, (aq) for aqueous solution).
*   **Limiting Reactant**: In reactions involving multiple reactants, the limiting reactant is the one that gets consumed first, determining the maximum amount of product that can be formed.
*   **Yield**: The percentage of theoretical yield obtained in a chemical reaction.

This module provides a foundational understanding of chemical reactions and stoichiometry.  Mastering the concepts outlined here is crucial for further study in chemistry and related fields.
