**Question 1:** What is the primary function of mitochondria?
A) Protein synthesis
B) ATP production
C) DNA storage
D) Waste removal
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They contain the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes that generate energy from glucose breakdown.

**Question 2:** Explain the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?
**Answer:** Prokaryotic cells lack a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles, while eukaryotic cells have both. Prokaryotes are generally smaller and simpler in structure.

**Question 3:** Which of the following best describes a balanced chemical equation?
A) A mixture of reactants and products.
B) An equation that shows the physical state of the substances involved.
C) An equation that represents the mass ratio of reactants and products.
D) An equation that accurately represents the quantities of reactants and products involved in a chemical reaction.
**Answer:** D
**Explanation:** A balanced chemical equation displays the precise mole ratios of reactants and products, reflecting the Law of Conservation of Mass and stoichiometric relationships. The coefficients represent the number of moles of each substance involved.

**Question 4:** What is the purpose of a catalyst in a chemical reaction?
A) To increase the temperature of the reaction.
B) To decrease the activation energy of the reaction.
C) To consume reactants during the reaction.
D) To change the physical state of the products.
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Catalysts lower the activation energy needed for a reaction to occur, speeding up the rate of the reaction without being consumed themselves, providing an alternative reaction pathway.

**Question 5:** Which type of reaction involves the exchange of electrons?
A) Precipitation reaction
B) Combustion reaction
C) Redox reaction
D) Acid-base neutralization
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Redox reactions (reduction-oxidation) always involve the transfer of electrons between reactants, while precipitation and acid-base reactions do not.

**Question 6:** Briefly describe the Law of Conservation of Mass?
**Answer:** The Law of Conservation of Mass states that matter is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction; the total mass of the reactants will always equal the total mass of the products. This principle is fundamental to balancing chemical equations.

**Question 7:** During the synthesis of a precipitate, what is the primary driving force behind the reaction?
**Answer:** The formation of an insoluble solid (precipitate) drives the reaction because the formation of a solid increases the entropy of the system, favoring the forward reaction. The solid’s formation provides a thermodynamic driving force.

**Question 8:** Explain how balancing chemical equations relates to the Law of Conservation of Mass.?
**Answer:** Balancing chemical equations ensures that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation, reflecting that matter isn’t created or destroyed; it’s simply rearrangeD) This directly applies the Law of Conservation of Mass.

**Question 9:** Imagine you are conducting an experiment to synthesize a precipitate. Describe the key steps you would take to ensure the formation of a solid.?
**Answer:** First, accurately measure and mix the reactants, ensuring the correct stoichiometric ratios. Next, carefully monitor the reaction mixture for signs of precipitation, such as the formation of a cloudy or solid appearance. Finally, filter the mixture to isolate the solid precipitate, confirming the formation and separation of the product.

**Question 10:**  Discuss a real-world application where understanding chemical reactions and stoichiometry is crucial.?
**Answer:**  The production of fertilizers relies heavily on stoichiometric calculations.  Farmers need to accurately determine the amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium required to maximize crop yielD) Improper ratios can lead to nutrient deficiencies or excessive fertilizer runoff, demonstrating the practical importance of balancing chemical equations and understanding molar relationships.
